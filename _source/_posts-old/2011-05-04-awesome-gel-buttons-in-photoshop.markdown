For something different, here is a try at a Photoshop tutorial. I haven't done one of these since 2001 or so, but I figure I'd share this little trick for making cool gel buttons in Photoshop.

I originally used some tutorials to learn this then made some tweaks and tricks of my own which I will share here.

Here is the gel button:
[![Gel button in photoshop](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg)](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg)

**1. File -> New**

Create an image that's 250px wide and 250px tall. The size here really doesn't matter, just choose something in that range. Leave the background contents transparent.

**2. Choose your colors**

For this tutorial we're making a purple button, so the colors I chose are:

Background: #7d0f58 (125,15,88)
Foreground: #a60d73 (166,13,115)

Select the Arrow shown above to switch the colors so the darker color is on top.

**3. Create a new layer named "shape"**

Select Layer -> New -> Layer (Ctrl+shift+N)

**4. Use the Rounded Rectangle Tool to create a rectangle**

This is the base for the button we're going to create.

Switch the colors again so the lighter color is on top

**5. Rasterize the Layer **

Right click on the layer containing the shape and select "rasterize"

This will make it so we can make modifications to the shape.

**6. Hold down the Control Key and click on the layer to select the shape. **

**7. Select a Paintbrush and make a highlight**

Use the brush to highlight the middle:** **

This doesn't have to be perfect, in fact a little imperfection looks pretty good.

**8. Choose Filter -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur **

[![Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-08.jpg)](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-08.jpg)

Select a radius of around 10 pixels.

**9. Create a gloss shape**

Create a new layer, and make another rounded rectangle shape:

Now Hide that shape, but click on the layer so you get the selection:

Create a new layer, and throw a white gradient in using these settings:

It should look something like this:

[![Photoshop Tutorials](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-12.jpg)](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-12.jpg)

Now click on **Select -> Modify -> Expand** and choose 10 pixels.

Then **Filter -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur** at 10 pixels.

Now select the gloss layer, and push the** up arrow **to move it up a little.

The finished product should look like this:

[![Glossy button in photoshop](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-13.jpg)](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-13.jpg)

You can then insert something under the gloss, and it looks like a button:

[![Gel button in photoshop](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg)](http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg)

This is a pretty subtle button, you can do more to change it around, like playing with the gradients, opacity and rounding the corners more. You can put a slight bevel on it and make it look even more like a button.
I hope this helps get you on your way to making cool gel buttons!
