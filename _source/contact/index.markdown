The easiest way to contact me is probably just to <a href="mailto:&#106;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#109;&#121;&#046;&#109;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;?&#115;&#117;&#098;&#106;&#101;&#099;&#116;="&#067;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#097;&#099;&#116;&#032;&#070;&#114;&#111;&#109;&#032;&#074;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#109;&#121;&#077;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">shoot me an email</a>.

Also if you're in the Portland, Oregon area here's my Meetup schedule:

Want SEO? 

## Other Recommended SEO Professionals: ##

Since I am super busy and not always able to take on new clients, I also recommend contacting the following SEO Professionals *:

Check out <a href="http://www.workingwebsolutions.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Working Web Solutions</strong></a>. Mary Killelea is also an SEO professional from the Portland Metro Area who is great at what she does, very professional and knowledgeable. Give her a call and see what she can do.

Also, <a href="http://www.davidmihm.com/" target="_blank"><strong>David Mihm</strong></a> is another reputable SEO in the Portland Area who I've heard great things about. He knows his stuff, and would be another great option.

## Free Help ##

Ok so you don't want to hire me but need some help for a personal project, non profit or simply a cash strapped business? That's ok too, I will answer questions and give you guidance as best I can but I prefer
to do that publicly so others can benefit from it as well. You can contact me on any of the usual social media outlets on the side, or you can post your question on Quora or Stack Overflow and ask me to answer it. There you will get 
not only my opinion but the opinions of many others as well.
