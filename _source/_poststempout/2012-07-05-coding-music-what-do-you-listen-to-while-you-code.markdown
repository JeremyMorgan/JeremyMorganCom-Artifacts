No matter what kind of work you do on the computer, you're likely familiar with "the zone". It's that time that you're focused like a laser beam, cranking out whatever work you're doing, the real passes "heads down" time that makes you forget time and produce great work. When you're in the zone, you have to lock out the outside world and it's almost a necessity to have some music pumping through headphones. So what do you listen to? Here's what I listen to when I'm really in the zone.

###What kind of music is best for coding?

This of course differs for everyone, some people want slow music, some need lightning fast. For me, I prefer

  * Music without lyrics
  * Upbeat tempo
  * techno or trance
  * Industrial
  * Classical

Ideally it should be something that blends into the background and doesn't distract me. I often build up lists on Grooveshark or my ipod depending on my mood.

Here's some of the artists I commonly listen to:
	
  * Carbon Based Lifeforms
  * Astral Projection
  * Issak Hypnotizer
  * Solar Fields
  * Aes Dana
  * Hol Baumann
  * I Awake
  * Hybrid Leisure-land
  * Thievery Corporation
  * Ludovico Eunaudi

Are you on Grooveshark? [Here's an awesome playlist](http://tinysong.com/p/54Z6B) containing much of this music.

### Binaural Beats

Also another thing I like to listen to is binaural beats. Many claim that these beats modify your brain, whether or not that's true I don't know but they do help me concentrate by providing a smooth, repeated sound. I use a freeware program called Gnaural most of the time to listen to this.

You can [download Gnaural here](http://gnaural.sourceforge.net/download/). 100% free.

I also use [BWGen](http://www.bwgen.com/) but you can only get the demo version, for some reason it's not available for purchase anymore. If you don't mind the 10 second startup time it's also a good program.



### So what are you listening to?

Leave some suggestions in the comments, I'm always open to new stuff, and I'll add more here as I find it.
