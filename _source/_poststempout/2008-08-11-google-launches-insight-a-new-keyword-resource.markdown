Google has recently launched [insight](http://google.com/insights/search/), a new keyword tool that looks very promising. You can track interest over time, regional information and more. This can give you even more dimensions into your keyword marketing plan. 


**What is insight? Why do I need it? **

In their own words: 

> With Google Insights for Search, you can compare search volume patterns across specific regions, categories, and time frames.

This appears to be a tool geared towards Marketers and SEOs, and allows you to track keywords according to some interesting metrics. 
	
  * Categories

	
  * Seasonality

	
  * Geographic Distribution

	
  * Interest Over Time


	
  * Regional Interest

	
  * Related Terms
	

  * Rising Searches

If utilized properly, one might be able to gauge trends in keywords, how people are searching, or how they may be searching in the future. If properly leveraged, you may be able to spot an up and coming subject and beat your competitors to the results pages. Also you may be able to spot trends you weren't otherwise aware of. Often times when doing work for clients, I find niche terms with low competition, and high search rates, and this is something you might find here. 

This tool is very simple, and provides some good data. Check out this [search for SEO](http://google.com/insights/search/#cat=&q=seo&geo=&date=&clp=&cmpt=q). Before doing this query, I didn't know India would be the leader in searches for that term (although I'm not terribly surprised). Things like this can help you get a better edge on the market, and I suggest bookmarking it and playing around. 

Check it out, and let me know what you guys think of it. Till then, I'm off to do my own research!
