I eat tons of fish. There are a lot of health benefits to it and it tastes pretty good. Lately I've been cooking a lot of Salmon and I've picked up a few good tricks for doing so.

**1. ** Buy or catch some Wild Salmon and thaw it if frozen.

**2.** Marinate

This one is a big step, you have to marinate. Here is what I often use for a marinate:

  * 2 parts  Lemon Juice
  * 1 part soy sauce
  * 1 part water

Let this soak for as long as you can, 3 hours or so is good, 5 or  6 is even better. Make sure and refrigerate it while you do.

**3**. Take some aluminum foil and coat it with olive oil. Use a napkin or something and coat all of the foil that will be touching the fish.  You can wrap the fillets individually or do them all in a big foil packet, doesn't matter. This is so the foil doesn't stick to the fish and burn it , plus it holds the salt and pepper as well.

**4**. Sprinkle sea salt and fresh ground pepper on the foil. You want it to stick to the foil.

**5**. Put the fillets inside the foil and put a bit of butter on each one. (Not margarine, but real butter).  Sprinkle some pepper on top of them fillets. Close it up tightly and make it into a "boat" so it cooks in the juices. You can also put a little soy sauce on each fillet if you want.

**6**. Cook it! There are two different ways to do it depending on your taste:

  * Low heat  in oven - This will cook slower, and meat will be much more moist. If you like it moist cook it this way (290 degrees for 45 mins)
  * High heat in oven or grill - This will cook faster, but salmon will be a bit more dry.  (300+ for 20-25 minutes)

This is a good way to eat Salmon that's healthy and simple. Feel free to leave comments about this!

**Note:** Make sure it's _always_ Wild Salmon. Fresh or frozen doesn't matter as much but it has to wild for taste and your health. You can get 2 pounds of frozen wild salmon for around $9-$10 at Walmart or WinCo that's really good. There are more expensive varieties at Trader Joe's, Safeway and Albertson's stores but I haven't noticed a difference.

Of course the best way is to catch it wild yourself and cook it up that night, but not always an option for everyone.
