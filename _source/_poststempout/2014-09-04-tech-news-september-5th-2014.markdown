Here's some tech news for September 5th, 2014. Cool stuff I found on the web, and decided to share.

###Articles

I found this cool link on Hacker News, [Fifty Years of Databases](http://wp.sigmod.org/?p=688) and it's a heck of a read. Very interesting to see how far we've come.

And in a funny case of history repeating itself, [Uber Is Currently Fighting the Battle That Jitneys Lost 100 Years Ago](http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/uber-is-currently-fighting-the-battle-that-jitneys-lost-1629552478). I still don't know how I feel about the Uber thing, but it's an interesting read none the less.

Check out [The Science of Crawl Part 1: Deduplication of Web Content](http://blog.urx.com/urx-blog/2014/9/4/the-science-of-crawl-part-1-deduplication-of-web-content) if you're interested in stuff like that (I am).

In sad news, [Twitpic is shutting down](http://blog.twitpic.com/2014/09/twitpic-is-shutting-down/). Yet another ridiculous show of greed by Twitter, rather than acquiring them, or working out some kind of deal, they just felt they needed to kill it. It's not a new tactic for Twitter, but upsetting anyway.



###Meetups

The next Portland Meetup I'll be attending is the [Portland SASS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/pdxSass/events/200404332/) at Puppet Labs. This meetup has grown considerably, and for good reason. The organizers have done a great job of creating awesome, useful presentations.

Another good one I might check out is [NodeJS Code & Learn night](http://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/190140022/), I've been to a couple before and it's always pretty interesting.

Ideas? comments? Feedback? Hit me up on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jeremycmorgan) or one of the [contact methods here](/contact).
