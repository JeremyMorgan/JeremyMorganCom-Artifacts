Want to learn how to write some apps for the Raspberry Pi? Today I'm going to kick off a new series of tutorials related to the Raspberry Pi and programming. This is a series that will be aimed at beginners, but seasoned programmers may want to take a look as well. The Raspberry Pi was created for education, tinkering and bringing technology to the far parts of the world. This is a mission I firmly stand behind, so I'm doing my part to throw some new stuff out there to get people excited about becoming a programmer with this awesome device. 


###Why Python?

Python is arguably the biggest programming language on the Pi right now, for good reason. It has lots of tools, is well supported and development is really fast. Plus it's easy to learn. It's very powerful and you can even create simple games and graphics with it. I think it's a great language to get started with as you'll see some instant results. 


###Tools we'll be using

We are going to be using Python and [IDLE](http://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html "IDLE for Python") for our first part of the tutorials, and these are already installed and present if you're using the Raspian image. Here is what IDLE looks like:

This is our Python console and editor. We'll be using this extensively to create our programs. While there are many IDEs out there, it's always good to start with the console, and learn a little how Python works. 

###Let's get started!

Let's get comfortable with the Python environment.
