  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had this problem tonight, so I thought I&#8217;d share the solution. In many languages you can do a string comparison in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>if ($city == "Portland" || $city == "Seattle") {
// stuff goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this works just fine. But in C#, strings are treated as objects, so you have to do the same comparison as such:</p>

<pre><code>if ((city == "Portland") || (city == "Seattle")) {
// stuff goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, if the city is Portland, it will evaluate as true, making it a boolean. This is a simple step and an easy fix, but I couldn&#8217;t readily find anything on google about it, so I thought I&#8217;d post it here.</p>

<p>If you want to use the || or operator in C#, this is how you do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, maybe need is strong word, but you should definitely check out Chrome, Google&#8217;s new web browser. I&#8217;ve downloaded it myself and found it to be pretty slick.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Click here to download Google Chrome</a></p>

<p><strong>Why Google Chrome?</strong></p>

<p>Why would google want to enter the browser wars? The simple answer is laid out in this <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/index.html">comic book style announcement</a>. Simply put, today&#8217;s browsers are built for mostly static webpages, with javascript on them. While AJAX has been around a while, only  in the last couple of years has it really taken off, and web 2.0 has taken over the net. These are not static pages anymore, they&#8217;re applications.</p>

<p>We now do all kinds of complicated actions on the web, with browsers that weren&#8217;t exactly built for it. So Google decided to start from the ground up and build something faster, and sleeker.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s it like? </strong>
My first impression of Google Chrome is very good. It&#8217;s lightweight, clean and simple. Changing tabs is quite fast, and things seem to load fast. I don&#8217;t notice a difference in looks at all. All webpages seem to look identical to how they look in FireFox. Even the fonts are the same (which I must admit I like Safari fonts better than any browser).</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had it crash yet, and it seems to run gmail very nice, as one would guess. I&#8217;ll give a more detailed analysis later, but I wanted to introduce you guys to this browser so you could check it out. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Click here for the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html">google blog</a> about Chrome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google has recently launched <a href="http://google.com/insights/search/">insight</a>, a new keyword tool that looks very promising. You can track interest over time, regional information and more. This can give you even more dimensions into your keyword marketing plan.</p>

<p><strong>What is insight? Why do I need it? </strong></p>

<p>In their own words:</p>

<blockquote><p>With Google Insights for Search, you can compare search volume patterns across specific regions, categories, and time frames.</p></blockquote>

<p>This appears to be a tool geared towards Marketers and SEOs, and allows you to track keywords according to some interesting metrics.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Categories</p></li>
<li><p>Seasonality</p></li>
<li><p>Geographic Distribution</p></li>
<li><p>Interest Over Time</p></li>
<li><p>Regional Interest</p></li>
<li><p>Related Terms</p></li>
<li><p>Rising Searches</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/google-insight.jpg" alt="Google Insight Screenshot" /></p>

<p>If utilized properly, one might be able to gauge trends in keywords, how people are searching, or how they may be searching in the future. If properly leveraged, you may be able to spot an up and coming subject and beat your competitors to the results pages. Also you may be able to spot trends you weren&#8217;t otherwise aware of. Often times when doing work for clients, I find niche terms with low competition, and high search rates, and this is something you might find here.</p>

<p>This tool is very simple, and provides some good data. Check out this <a href="http://google.com/insights/search/#cat=&amp;q=seo&amp;geo=&amp;date=&amp;clp=&amp;cmpt=q">search for SEO</a>. Before doing this query, I didn&#8217;t know India would be the leader in searches for that term (although I&#8217;m not terribly surprised). Things like this can help you get a better edge on the market, and I suggest bookmarking it and playing around.</p>

<p>Check it out, and let me know what you guys think of it. Till then, I&#8217;m off to do my own research!</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-06T14:53:53+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 6<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cuil is a startup who has created a search engine they say can spider more content faster and cheaper than Google. They have received a surprising amount of press, most likely because <a href="http://www.cuil.com/info/management/">some of the founders of cuil</a> are ex employees of Google. Should we be paying attention?</p>

<p><strong>What is so special about Cuil?</strong>
If Cuil plans to earn a spot in the search engine arena, they will have to provide something completely unique and different than anything Google has. So far, from a user perspective, I noticed that I like the cosmetics of the interface however it&#8217;s not terribly useful.</p>

<p>The simple search box in front is nice, but google has that also. When you perform a search, your results are placed into boxes that fill up the page, with a photo attached to most listings. While this looks neat, I can&#8217;t see it being that nice when you are searching for something for hours on end. Who hasn&#8217;t perused through 10 or more pages on google looking for something? Their simple listings are nice, and with cuil you seem to get more clutter when doing the same thing.</p>

<p>The listings also seem outdated for some things, and maybe I&#8217;m just bitter because <a href="http://www.cuil.com/search?q=jeremymorgan.com">my site doesn&#8217;t show up at all</a>. In fact I noticed a few sites that haven&#8217;t been spidered yet.</p>

<p>One positive note, the spammers have yet to discover it, or they are being weeded out well. I had a hard time finding spam pages.</p>

<p><strong>Will the public embrace it? </strong></p>

<p>There is no doubt that webmasters and marketers will pay attention to this new, flashy search engine. But will users embrace it? That remains to be seen. Here are a few disadvantages:</p>

<p>People know Google. It&#8217;s a verb now.
habits are hard to break. Some people are still using metacrawler.
The name is confusing, and can be misspelled.
The name is not memorable.
The buzz wont last for long. After that they need substance.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we should be mindful of this new search engine, but for the time being I won&#8217;t be investing any serious time in optimizing for their site. I don&#8217;t see enough to lure the masses away, and once the hype dies down, its likely they will collect dust. While there is a lot of buzz going on now, it can be forgotten tommorow.</p>

<p>Like other marketers, I will keep my eye on the site, and attempt to get some pages in there. I&#8217;ll check my logs to see if they&#8217;re even sending anyone. But as far as going out of my way&#8230; not yet. Only time will tell whether this flash in the pan will actually succeed. After all, nobody thought Yahoo would ever be topped, and it only took a few short years for Google to become #1. And what it will take to succeed is converting enough average, ordinary users to the site. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

<time datetime="2008-08-06T12:51:36+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 6<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Google quietly released <a href="http://knol.google.com/">Knol</a>, an online encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia. Immediately the SEO community started buzzing about it, and SEOs wondered how they can start utilizing it.</p>

<p><strong>Does Google favor Knol pages? </strong>
I don&#8217;t have an definitive answer to this, but intuition tells me yes. It does, and it will favor knol pages in the future, and several people have proven it. The reason is simply that google favors authority pages, as I have written about in the past. And there is the obvious house advantage, google will likely try to push their own product.</p>

<p>How many times have you spotted a wikipedia article at the top of a SERP? It happens all the time, and the reason for this is simple: Google considers Wikipedia articles to be a decent authority on the subject. Aside from all the inbound links, and massive traffic, this could be the primary reason wiki often earns the top spot. Whether they are actually a good authority or not is certainly arguable, but currently wiki articles are given pretty good juice in SERPS.</p>

<p>With Knol, they are able to control the content of the articles, something they cannot do with Wikipedia. So in theory, if they start linking to Knol pages, they are giving an authority page a high ranking, and one that they can control the content of. If Google can implement quality control on this new encyclopedia, they can better direct what sort of content their searchers land on.</p>

<p><strong>How do you take advantage of it? </strong>
The best way you can take advantage of Knol pages is to start creating them. Become an &#8220;authority&#8221; on the topic, and make sure to sprinkle your links on pages as needed. Later down the road, if Knol really takes off, you&#8217;ll be glad you got your spot when you did. Even if it doesn&#8217;t give you SEO improvement, it&#8217;s another opportunity to get your name out there. I would recommend getting on there now, and start putting up content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>What is an array? </strong>
Arrays are common to almost every programming language. An array is simply an ordered map of values, indexed so you can find these values, called <em>elements</em>. These elements can be of multiple datatypes, and can be ordered any way you want.</p>

<p>Array
(
[a] => 1
[b] => 2
[c] => 3
)</p>

<p><strong>Two types of arrays in PHP</strong>
There are two types of arrays in PHP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative">enumerative</a>. The difference between the two is how they are indexed.</p>

<p><strong>Associative array</strong>s allow you to index each element with an arbitrary value. For example, you can use letters of the alphabet, or just about anything to index the value, as long as it&#8217;s unique. Here is an example:</p>

<p>Array
(
[name] => Jeremy
[website] => jeremymorgan.com
[occupation] => developer
)
`</p>

<p>Some programmers prefer associative arrays because they can use the key to indicate what type of data is stored in the element, like &#8220;name&#8221; in the above example. This is an indicator of what is stored, however its not a rule that&#8217;s enforced. You can just as easily put a phone number in a name field and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Enumerative arrays</strong> are indexed with a numerical index, either auto incremented, or random. PHP is very flexible with arrays, you can use numbers at will, and add in associative elements, and return to enumerative again. Also, the keys do not need to be sequential. Also note if you leave a key blank, an auto incremented number will be assigned to the key. Here is an example of an enumerative array:</p>

<p>Array
(
[0] => Jeremy
[1] => jeremymorgan.com
[2] => developer
)`</p>

<p><strong>How to build an array in PHP</strong></p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array function</a> you can create arrays a few different ways:</p>

<p>$ourary = array (1,2,3);
$ourary = array (&#8216;a&#8217; => &#8216;1&#8217;, &#8216;b&#8217; => &#8216;2&#8217;, &#8216;c&#8217; => &#8216;3&#8217;);
$ourary = array ();`</p>

<p><strong>What do we do with arrays? </strong></p>

<p>There are a few neat things we can do with arrays. You can extract only specific parts of an array:</p>

<p><code>
$name = $ourary['name'];
</code></p>

<p>or you can loop through an array:</p>

<p><code>
$ourary = array(0 =&gt; 'Jeremy', 1 =&gt; 'jeremymorgan.com', 2 =&gt; 'developer');</code></p>

<p>foreach ($ourary as $value) {</p>

<p>echo &#8220;Value: $value&#8221;;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>There are many things arrays can be really handy for, and I&#8217;ll cover that in future articles.</p>

<p><strong>Checking your arrays</strong></p>

<p>One question you might have is, how to easily check the data in the array. There are two easy ways to do this.</p>

<p>print_r($yourary);</p>

<p>This will display the contents of your array so you can visually verify the data before processing it. Print_r will recursively print the values of your elements. Here is another way:</p>

<p>var_dump($yourary);</p>

<p>This also prints out the values of your elements, but displays the datatypes as well. Whether or not you need this functionality will determine whether you use print_r or var_dump.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Arrays are a beautiful thing. Mastering them is key to success in any language. In future articles I will cover some of the things you can do with arrays.</p>

<p><strong>How to build an array in PHP</strong></p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array function</a> you can create arrays a few different ways:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ourary = array (1,2,3);
</span><span class='line'>$ourary = array ('a' =&gt; '1', 'b' =&gt; '2', 'c' =&gt; '3');
</span><span class='line'>$ourary = array ();`</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>What do we do with arrays? </strong></p>

<p>There are a few neat things we can do with arrays. You can extract only specific parts of an array:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$name = $ourary['name'];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or you can loop through an array:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ourary = array(0 =&gt; 'Jeremy', 1 =&gt; 'jeremymorgan.com', 2 =&gt; 'developer');`
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>foreach ($ourary as $value) {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    echo "Value: $value";
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are many things arrays can be really handy for, and I&#8217;ll cover that in future articles.</p>

<p><strong>Checking your arrays</strong></p>

<p>One question you might have is, how to easily check the data in the array. There are two easy ways to do this.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>print_r($yourary);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will display the contents of your array so you can visually verify the data before processing it. Print_r will recursively print the values of your elements. Here is another way:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var_dump($yourary);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This also prints out the values of your elements, but displays the datatypes as well. Whether or not you need this functionality will determine whether you use print_r or var_dump.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Arrays are a beautiful thing. Mastering them is key to success in any language. In future articles I will cover some of the things you can do with arrays.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The question I&#8217;m asked frequently - &#8220;how can I optimize my flash site for SEO?&#8221; now will have a better answer. Generally I advise people on how to optimize flash but I still advise excessive use of flash. It looks like that may not be much of a problem soon.</p>

<p>Today Adobe Systems Announced they are teaming up with search industry leaders to improve search results of dynamic Web content and rich Internet applications (RIAs). Adobe will be providing optimized flash player technology to Google and yahoo! to improve search engine indexing of .swf files.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200806/070108AdobeRichMediaSearch.html">Read the full story here</a></p>

<p>This is great news for SEOs and web developers alike. I&#8217;m very excited to see how this turns out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, this isn&#8217;t a joke headline, or something to entice you to click. Google has decided to open up (a little) of their algorithm. This is great news for some, and a surprising move by the world&#8217;s most popular search engine.</p>

<p>Obviously Google has kept their algorithms secret for competitive and abuse reasons, and I&#8217;m surprised at <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/introduction-to-google-search-quality.html">this announcement</a>. Black and White hat SEOs have been reverse engineering this algorithm for years and this closely guarded secret has never truly leaked to the masses, so this is like manna from heaven right? Not exactly, but they are giving some hints and things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>What is the &#8220;Google algorithm?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year I wrote an article about the Google algorithm (which actually is a combination of thousands of algorithms I imagine, however it&#8217;s easier to speak of them as one) and they confirm it, and also expand on my theory of it.</p>

<p>What does &#8220;the algorithm&#8221; consist of? From their post:</p>

<blockquote><p>The most famous part of our ranking algorithm is PageRank, an algorithm developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who founded Google. PageRank is still in use today, but it is now a part of a much larger system. Other parts include language models (the ability to handle phrases, synonyms, diacritics, spelling mistakes, and so on), query models (it&#8217;s not just the language, it&#8217;s how people use it today), time models (some queries are best answered with a 30-minutes old page, and some are better answered with a page that stood the test of time), and personalized models (not all people want the same thing).</p></blockquote>

<p>This article is the most information google has ever given out on how their search quality works, (short of the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769">webmaster guidelines</a>, which everyone should read) so this is a big step. And it sounds like they&#8217;re going to give out more.</p>

<p><strong>Why are they opening up? </strong></p>

<p>This is definitely the question of the day, and I have no answer for that. Perhaps it&#8217;s a part of the &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">don&#8217;t be evil</a>&#8221; pledge that some say they are drifting from. There are an equal amount of Google &#8220;haters&#8221; as well as fans, and they have suffered from a lot of criticism lately, and perhaps this is a move to help that in a small way. It&#8217;s unlikely their spot as the top search engine will be compromised anyway, so they figure this is a harmless move to appear more open and friendly. That&#8217;s my guess.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/introduction-to-google-search-quality.html">read over the article</a>, and keep an eye on their corporate blog, you might be able to learn something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of emails about using my articles on other websites, or even printed materials. Some are asking about getting permission, and cost, etc. I&#8217;ll explain how you can do that, absolutely free.</p>

<p><strong>Can I put your articles on my website?</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is yes. Everything published on JeremyMorgan.com is covered by a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">creative commons</a> license. This means you can use my content free of charge, as long as you follow certain rules.</p>

<p>I use two different CC licenses:</p>

<p><strong>Articles: </strong></p>

<p>The articles are covered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/">CCA - No Derivative</a> License. This means you can copy, distribute and share my work free of charge. This means you can use my articles:</p>

<p>For your website/forums
In your newsletter
In printed materials - newsletters, magazines and books.
In your Ebook
On your blog.</p>

<p>The only restriction is you cannot modify or add on to the work in any way. You also must attribute my work, meaning if it is used online, you must display that I am the author, with a link back to JeremyMorgan.com. If it is in printed material, you must credit me as well, but you may spell out jeremymorgan.com (obviously hyperlinks don&#8217;t work on paper).</p>

<p>You may also use it for commercial purposes, meaning if you&#8217;re selling a product, service, or publication you may use the articles, provided the rules above are followed, with no royalties paid to me.</p>

<p><strong>Software / Code</strong></p>

<p>Any software or source code, html, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc is covered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">CCA - Attribution Share</a> license. This means everything that applies to articles is true, you can use my source code and applications on your site, in your book, or even in your commercial software, again with no royalties. The difference is you can modify, add on to or reduce the work, or integrate it into your own application. If you add on or modify it, you must share the work and make it available if requested. You do not need to include a hyperlink in my web applications, but you must leave the attribution information in the license.</p>

<p><strong>Why do I do this? </strong>
I was asked this by someone who wanted to purchase an article from me. Why the heck am I doing this? For one, I want to contribute to the body of free knowledge about SEO. This site is by far more of a &#8220;for fun&#8221; site than a commercial one. I want to help others, and hopefully help out in some small way.</p>

<p>Also, I want to get my name out there. Obviously the more people publish my work, the more my name will be out there, and the more well known my work will become. Not everything has to be done for a profit!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. If you&#8217;re interested in doing the same thing with your work, check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">creative commons</a> site, and choose a license.</p>

<p>So use my work, spread it freely and hopefully it helps!</p>
