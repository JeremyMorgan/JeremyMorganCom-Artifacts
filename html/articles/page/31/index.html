  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cuil is a startup who has created a search engine they say can spider more content faster and cheaper than Google. They have received a surprising amount of press, most likely because <a href="http://www.cuil.com/info/management/">some of the founders of cuil</a> are ex employees of Google. Should we be paying attention?</p>

<p><strong>What is so special about Cuil?</strong>
If Cuil plans to earn a spot in the search engine arena, they will have to provide something completely unique and different than anything Google has. So far, from a user perspective, I noticed that I like the cosmetics of the interface however it&#8217;s not terribly useful.</p>

<p>The simple search box in front is nice, but google has that also. When you perform a search, your results are placed into boxes that fill up the page, with a photo attached to most listings. While this looks neat, I can&#8217;t see it being that nice when you are searching for something for hours on end. Who hasn&#8217;t perused through 10 or more pages on google looking for something? Their simple listings are nice, and with cuil you seem to get more clutter when doing the same thing.</p>

<p>The listings also seem outdated for some things, and maybe I&#8217;m just bitter because <a href="http://www.cuil.com/search?q=jeremymorgan.com">my site doesn&#8217;t show up at all</a>. In fact I noticed a few sites that haven&#8217;t been spidered yet.</p>

<p>One positive note, the spammers have yet to discover it, or they are being weeded out well. I had a hard time finding spam pages.</p>

<p><strong>Will the public embrace it? </strong></p>

<p>There is no doubt that webmasters and marketers will pay attention to this new, flashy search engine. But will users embrace it? That remains to be seen. Here are a few disadvantages:</p>

<p>People know Google. It&#8217;s a verb now.
habits are hard to break. Some people are still using metacrawler.
The name is confusing, and can be misspelled.
The name is not memorable.
The buzz wont last for long. After that they need substance.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that we should be mindful of this new search engine, but for the time being I won&#8217;t be investing any serious time in optimizing for their site. I don&#8217;t see enough to lure the masses away, and once the hype dies down, its likely they will collect dust. While there is a lot of buzz going on now, it can be forgotten tommorow.</p>

<p>Like other marketers, I will keep my eye on the site, and attempt to get some pages in there. I&#8217;ll check my logs to see if they&#8217;re even sending anyone. But as far as going out of my way&#8230; not yet. Only time will tell whether this flash in the pan will actually succeed. After all, nobody thought Yahoo would ever be topped, and it only took a few short years for Google to become #1. And what it will take to succeed is converting enough average, ordinary users to the site. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, Google quietly released <a href="http://knol.google.com/">Knol</a>, an online encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia. Immediately the SEO community started buzzing about it, and SEOs wondered how they can start utilizing it.</p>

<p><strong>Does Google favor Knol pages? </strong>
I don&#8217;t have an definitive answer to this, but intuition tells me yes. It does, and it will favor knol pages in the future, and several people have proven it. The reason is simply that google favors authority pages, as I have written about in the past. And there is the obvious house advantage, google will likely try to push their own product.</p>

<p>How many times have you spotted a wikipedia article at the top of a SERP? It happens all the time, and the reason for this is simple: Google considers Wikipedia articles to be a decent authority on the subject. Aside from all the inbound links, and massive traffic, this could be the primary reason wiki often earns the top spot. Whether they are actually a good authority or not is certainly arguable, but currently wiki articles are given pretty good juice in SERPS.</p>

<p>With Knol, they are able to control the content of the articles, something they cannot do with Wikipedia. So in theory, if they start linking to Knol pages, they are giving an authority page a high ranking, and one that they can control the content of. If Google can implement quality control on this new encyclopedia, they can better direct what sort of content their searchers land on.</p>

<p><strong>How do you take advantage of it? </strong>
The best way you can take advantage of Knol pages is to start creating them. Become an &#8220;authority&#8221; on the topic, and make sure to sprinkle your links on pages as needed. Later down the road, if Knol really takes off, you&#8217;ll be glad you got your spot when you did. Even if it doesn&#8217;t give you SEO improvement, it&#8217;s another opportunity to get your name out there. I would recommend getting on there now, and start putting up content.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>What is an array? </strong>
Arrays are common to almost every programming language. An array is simply an ordered map of values, indexed so you can find these values, called <em>elements</em>. These elements can be of multiple datatypes, and can be ordered any way you want.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Array
</span><span class='line'>(
</span><span class='line'>    [a] =&gt; 1
</span><span class='line'>    [b] =&gt; 2
</span><span class='line'>    [c] =&gt; 3
</span><span class='line'>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Two types of arrays in PHP</strong></p>

<p>There are two types of arrays in PHP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array">associative</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative">enumerative</a>. The difference between the two is how they are indexed.</p>

<p><strong>Associative array</strong>s allow you to index each element with an arbitrary value. For example, you can use letters of the alphabet, or just about anything to index the value, as long as it&#8217;s unique. Here is an example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Array
</span><span class='line'>(
</span><span class='line'>    [name] =&gt; Jeremy
</span><span class='line'>    [website] =&gt; jeremymorgan.com
</span><span class='line'>    [occupation] =&gt; developer
</span><span class='line'>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Some programmers prefer associative arrays because they can use the key to indicate what type of data is stored in the element, like &#8220;name&#8221; in the above example. This is an indicator of what is stored, however its not a rule that&#8217;s enforced. You can just as easily put a phone number in a name field and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Enumerative arrays</strong> are indexed with a numerical index, either auto incremented, or random. PHP is very flexible with arrays, you can use numbers at will, and add in associative elements, and return to enumerative again. Also, the keys do not need to be sequential. Also note if you leave a key blank, an auto incremented number will be assigned to the key. Here is an example of an enumerative array:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Array
</span><span class='line'>(
</span><span class='line'>    [0] =&gt; Jeremy
</span><span class='line'>    [1] =&gt; jeremymorgan.com
</span><span class='line'>    [2] =&gt; developer
</span><span class='line'>)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>How to build an array in PHP</strong></p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array function</a> you can create arrays a few different ways:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ourary = array (1,2,3);
</span><span class='line'>$ourary = array ('a' =&gt; '1', 'b' =&gt; '2', 'c' =&gt; '3');
</span><span class='line'>$ourary = array ();`</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>What do we do with arrays? </strong></p>

<p>There are a few neat things we can do with arrays. You can extract only specific parts of an array:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$name = $ourary['name'];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>or you can loop through an array:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ourary = array(0 =&gt; 'Jeremy', 1 =&gt; 'jeremymorgan.com', 2 =&gt; 'developer');`
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>foreach ($ourary as $value) {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    echo "Value: $value";
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are many things arrays can be really handy for, and I&#8217;ll cover that in future articles.</p>

<p><strong>Checking your arrays</strong></p>

<p>One question you might have is, how to easily check the data in the array. There are two easy ways to do this.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>print_r($yourary);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will display the contents of your array so you can visually verify the data before processing it. Print_r will recursively print the values of your elements. Here is another way:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var_dump($yourary);</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This also prints out the values of your elements, but displays the datatypes as well. Whether or not you need this functionality will determine whether you use print_r or var_dump.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Arrays are a beautiful thing. Mastering them is key to success in any language. In future articles I will cover some of the things you can do with arrays.</p>

<p>Today Adobe Systems Announced they are teaming up with search industry leaders to improve search results of dynamic Web content and rich Internet applications (RIAs). Adobe will be providing optimized flash player technology to Google and yahoo! to improve search engine indexing of .swf files.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No, this isn&#8217;t a joke headline, or something to entice you to click. Google has decided to open up (a little) of their algorithm. This is great news for some, and a surprising move by the world&#8217;s most popular search engine.</p>

<p>Obviously Google has kept their algorithms secret for competitive and abuse reasons, and I&#8217;m surprised at <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/introduction-to-google-search-quality.html">this announcement</a>. Black and White hat SEOs have been reverse engineering this algorithm for years and this closely guarded secret has never truly leaked to the masses, so this is like manna from heaven right? Not exactly, but they are giving some hints and things to consider.</p>

<p><strong>What is the &#8220;Google algorithm?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year I wrote an article about the Google algorithm (which actually is a combination of thousands of algorithms I imagine, however it&#8217;s easier to speak of them as one) and they confirm it, and also expand on my theory of it.</p>

<p>What does &#8220;the algorithm&#8221; consist of? From their post:</p>

<blockquote><p>The most famous part of our ranking algorithm is PageRank, an algorithm developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who founded Google. PageRank is still in use today, but it is now a part of a much larger system. Other parts include language models (the ability to handle phrases, synonyms, diacritics, spelling mistakes, and so on), query models (it&#8217;s not just the language, it&#8217;s how people use it today), time models (some queries are best answered with a 30-minutes old page, and some are better answered with a page that stood the test of time), and personalized models (not all people want the same thing).</p></blockquote>

<p>This article is the most information google has ever given out on how their search quality works, (short of the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769">webmaster guidelines</a>, which everyone should read) so this is a big step. And it sounds like they&#8217;re going to give out more.</p>

<p><strong>Why are they opening up? </strong></p>

<p>This is definitely the question of the day, and I have no answer for that. Perhaps it&#8217;s a part of the &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">don&#8217;t be evil</a>&#8221; pledge that some say they are drifting from. There are an equal amount of Google &#8220;haters&#8221; as well as fans, and they have suffered from a lot of criticism lately, and perhaps this is a move to help that in a small way. It&#8217;s unlikely their spot as the top search engine will be compromised anyway, so they figure this is a harmless move to appear more open and friendly. That&#8217;s my guess.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/introduction-to-google-search-quality.html">read over the article</a>, and keep an eye on their corporate blog, you might be able to learn something.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of emails about using my articles on other websites, or even printed materials. Some are asking about getting permission, and cost, etc. I&#8217;ll explain how you can do that, absolutely free.</p>

<p><strong>Can I put your articles on my website?</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is yes. Everything published on JeremyMorgan.com is covered by a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">creative commons</a> license. This means you can use my content free of charge, as long as you follow certain rules.</p>

<p>I use two different CC licenses:</p>

<p><strong>Articles: </strong></p>

<p>The articles are covered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/">CCA - No Derivative</a> License. This means you can copy, distribute and share my work free of charge. This means you can use my articles:</p>

<p>For your website/forums
In your newsletter
In printed materials - newsletters, magazines and books.
In your Ebook
On your blog.</p>

<p>The only restriction is you cannot modify or add on to the work in any way. You also must attribute my work, meaning if it is used online, you must display that I am the author, with a link back to JeremyMorgan.com. If it is in printed material, you must credit me as well, but you may spell out jeremymorgan.com (obviously hyperlinks don&#8217;t work on paper).</p>

<p>You may also use it for commercial purposes, meaning if you&#8217;re selling a product, service, or publication you may use the articles, provided the rules above are followed, with no royalties paid to me.</p>

<p><strong>Software / Code</strong></p>

<p>Any software or source code, html, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc is covered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">CCA - Attribution Share</a> license. This means everything that applies to articles is true, you can use my source code and applications on your site, in your book, or even in your commercial software, again with no royalties. The difference is you can modify, add on to or reduce the work, or integrate it into your own application. If you add on or modify it, you must share the work and make it available if requested. You do not need to include a hyperlink in my web applications, but you must leave the attribution information in the license.</p>

<p><strong>Why do I do this? </strong>
I was asked this by someone who wanted to purchase an article from me. Why the heck am I doing this? For one, I want to contribute to the body of free knowledge about SEO. This site is by far more of a &#8220;for fun&#8221; site than a commercial one. I want to help others, and hopefully help out in some small way.</p>

<p>Also, I want to get my name out there. Obviously the more people publish my work, the more my name will be out there, and the more well known my work will become. Not everything has to be done for a profit!</p>

<p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. If you&#8217;re interested in doing the same thing with your work, check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">creative commons</a> site, and choose a license.</p>

<p>So use my work, spread it freely and hopefully it helps!</p>

<time datetime="2008-02-09T02:01:19+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 9<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wondered how the Google algorithm really works? I&#8217;ve gathered some info from trusted sources as to how Google ranks pages. This is information piled together from Google, Matt Cutts and others about how the algorithm works. (Roughly).</p>

<p>The following is my theory on how the Google algorithm works. I used to give this to my SEO clients, on a &#8220;as is&#8221; basis. What that means is, this is simply a theory based on available data and my own observations. It is by no means law, and of course I don&#8217;t have the actual weights involved, but I still think this information is a good guideline.</p>

<p>Lets start with the page. Here are your page-level factors. All of these factor in keywords, but keep in mind that overloading and spamming these elements will be detected by Google.</p>

<h3>Page Level Factors</h3>

<p><strong>Title Tag</strong> - What keywords are in it, most important first, left to right.
<strong>Header Tags</strong> - H1-H6 tags, their content and placement on the page
<strong>Page Content</strong> - All content contained in text of the page (non-code)
<strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Anything included in metatags. <em>Note: As far as I can tell, the only tag really used by Google is the description tag, in lieu of text on your page</em>
<strong>Internal Link Text</strong> - How other pages link to this page
<strong>URL</strong> - Keywords in URL (often spammed, something that may go to the wayside someday).</p>

<p>Google takes in all these factors as a base for your serps. From this data it gathers:</p>

<p><strong>Keywords and phrases</strong> (what are they? what is the density?)
<strong>Keyword proximity</strong> (are the keywords too dense or packed together?)
<strong>Natural Language check</strong> (is it non-nonsensical text generated by software?)
<strong>Uniqueness</strong> (is this text that is used all over the net?)</p>

<h3>What Google Wants:</h3>

<p>Google wants unique, human generated text that is relevant to the content you are providing, that is as natural as possible. Not keyword stuffed super dense text, but actual text people can read and understand. It is also looking for good semantics, as referenced in <a href="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/page-optimization-for-dummies/">page optimization for dummies</a>.</p>

<h3>Domain Factors</h3>

<p>Google also takes into account some things about your domain. Here are some of the factors:
<strong>Domain age</strong>
<strong>History of Registrants</strong> (changed often?)
<strong>Backlinks</strong> to base domain
<strong>&#8220;Neighborhood&#8221;</strong> or who you link to, and who links to you.
<strong>Registration length</strong> (if you register for 5 years, you might be more serious about the domain)
<strong>History of the domain</strong> (what did it contain before? what is there now?)</p>

<h3>Inbound Link Factors</h3>

<p><strong>Quality of inbound links.</strong> (all the factors above, who is linking to you?)
<strong>Age of domains linking to you</strong>
<strong>IPs of those domains </strong>(hint: if they all have the same IP, don&#8217;t count on it helping)
<strong>Neighborhood of those domains.</strong>
<strong>How long they&#8217;ve been linking to you</strong> (if 5000 new sites link to you in a week, may trigger a flag)
<strong>Do they accept paid links?</strong> Have they been <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-report-paid-links/">reported</a>?
Are they link farms?</p>

<h3>User Data</h3>

<p>(mostly applies to those who use Google analytics)
<strong>Bounce Rate</strong> (are people leaving your page instantly? This is not a good sign)
<strong>How long do they stay?</strong> (again, is your page relevant to what they are looking for?)
<strong>searches for your domain </strong>(how many people search for jeremymorgan.com?)
<strong>CTR on SERPS</strong> (this one I&#8217;m not so sure of. But sources say this matters)</p>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>

<p>Here is where I inject my conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat type of stuff. I personally think that Google not only reviews feedback other people send about your site, but they use human reviewers. They have staff who peruse SEO forums looking for someone bragging about tricking Google and getting a great SERP, etc. This is completely unsupported by fact, but my personal belief. I have a hard time believing a company as smart as Google wouldn&#8217;t hire real humans to do this type of quality assurance. I&#8217;m not knocking them for it, as a white hat SEO, I encourage them to weed out spammers. But I have no real evidence that they actually do this.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many factors that Google uses to determine your SERP. In the end, honesty matters. Eventually, Google will end up putting the most relevant sites at the top, for the benefit of their users. So rather than trying to &#8220;trick&#8221; Google, try putting up content worthy of close scrutiny and make it good enough people will link it. Google will do the rest!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now everyone knows the importance of keywords to your SEO strategy. So if you know what you&#8217;re targeting, you can buy hundreds of different kinds of keyword finding programs these days. But are they neccessary? Turns out there are plenty of free ways to get good keywords out there.</p>

<p>The science behind finding good keywords isn&#8217;t the scope of this article, I&#8217;m just going to show you where to find sites that provide keywords for you free. There is a wrong way, and a right way to use keywords, and it all depends on focus. See my article on <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-marketing/targeting-more-traffic-isnt-always-better/">keyword targeting</a>. But here are some tools you can find to get permutations and variations on  your original theme.</p>

<p>Wordtracker&#8217;s <a href="http://freekeywords.wordtracker.com/">Free Keyword Suggestion Tool</a> is one of the best. If you can afford the paid service, word tracker is worth every penny. You can do detailed keyword analysis, comparisons, KEI, and more, and export your lists to a format of your choosing. I use it and highly recommend it.</p>

<p><a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">Google adwords keyword</a> tool is another awesome tool, especially if you use adwords. This will give you a good idea of the popularity of your term, and the cost.</p>

<p>Those of you who have purchased <a href="http://www.seobook.com/3225.html">the SEO Book</a> (you really should) already know about Aaron&#8217;s <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/keyword-tools/seobook/">free keyword tool</a>. It&#8217;s very useful and nice.</p>

<p>I would post more, but this is really all you need. You don&#8217;t need to spend a bunch of money on software to find this stuff. The only paid service I recommend is word tracker, only because of the immense value they give you. Enjoy these tools, and get to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Search Engine Optimization isn&#8217;t as hard as you might think.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re competing for top terms, you&#8217;ve got a lot of work ahead of you, but success is still within your reach. Often times top results aren&#8217;t held by giant corporations with thousands in advertising budgets. A lot of times, its a small company or one man show at the top. So how do you get up there?</p>

<p><strong>
1. Content Content Content! </strong></p>

<p>This rule is number one for a reason. It&#8217;s the most important. All the &#8220;optimizing&#8221; in the world isn&#8217;t going to get you to the top, and if it does, you won&#8217;t stay there. What you really need to  focus on is creating reasons for your visitors to come back. Give them free stuff, advice, articles, or tools. There is no limit to what you can come up with a little creativity. Make it interesting, original, and useful. Your site will sell itself soon.</p>

<p><strong>2. Clean up your code. </strong></p>

<p>You can have two separate pages that look exactly the same in the browser, but completely different under the hood. Learn html, and learn how to do it well. Learn everything you can about standards compliance, <a href="http://www.w3.org">w3c rules</a>, table less designs and web semantics. All of these things will enable crawlers to go through your site better, and find your content better. This step alone makes a giant difference.</p>

<p><strong>3. Utilize forums to your advantage.</strong></p>

<p>Forums and message boards are a great way to get the word out about your site. This adds several dimensions so your promotional strategy. First off links in your signature count as backlinks in search engines. Any links you post there will add up, and if it&#8217;s a large forum you can also get some traffic that way. Also, you are getting your name out there, and branding your site. The more friendly and helpful you are to others, the more they will associate that with your site. Many large sites have started from people who were popular on messageboards. Also, this provides excellent networking opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>4. Go high tech. </strong></p>

<p>The only thing stopping you from having really cool stuff on your website is you. You can learn html, php, asp, javascript
and more free online. All it takes is some dedication and a few hours here and there to take tutorials and learn. If you
polish your skills enough, you can learn how to build all the neat features you see on other websites, or create your own.
Get good enough, and you will be able to build anything you think of. There are lots of free tutorials and messageboards
that will help you learn to succeed! You dont have to spend a dime.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get backlinks. </strong></p>

<p>Submit to every free link directory you can think of. Run a blog? There are only thousands of blog directories on the
internet. As I mentioned before, put links in your forum signatures. Submit to every search engine you can ever think of.
Also, setting up link exchanges with other sites works well too. Also, adding as much content as you can pile on will
get people linking in. A few links here and there for every new page or article will add up over time. Eventually, you&#8217;ll
become an authority and enjoy higher rankings, and more traffic!</p>

<p>The bottom line is dedication. You can spend piles of money, or you can take time alone to build it up yourself. No other
business or industry has provided you with so much opportunity. Use it wisely!</p>
