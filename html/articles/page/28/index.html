  <div class="entry-content"><p>The &#8220;hello world&#8221; app is always the first thing most students do in any language. Java is no different, and I&#8217;ll show you how easy it is here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/rtknqrUbq6M">Java Tutorial - Hello World</a></p>

<p>This tutorial makes a few assumptions. We&#8217;ve assumed that you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">installed the JDK</a> and have it running. For this tutorial I&#8217;m using Ubuntu Linux at the command line, but the code is the same if you&#8217;re using Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create File </strong></p>

<p>Create a file called &#8220;HelloWorld.java&#8221;. In there type the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>class HelloWorld {
</span><span class='line'>  public static void main(String[] args) {
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>      System.out.println("Hello World!");
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code is pretty self explanatory. We&#8217;re creating a class called &#8220;HelloWorld&#8221;. When that class executes the first thing that runs is the main() method. Within that method we have a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/System.html">System.out.println</a> method that outputs text.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: compile</strong></p>

<p>To compile this, we simply type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>javac HelloWorld.java</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This compiles into a file named HelloWorld.class</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Run</strong></p>

<p>To run this file, we type in:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>java HelloWorld</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And it outputs text. It&#8217;s that easy!</p>

<p>Now find some ways to make text output interesting. There are thousands of cool things you can do at the console.</p>

<time datetime="2010-07-22T10:46:44+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 22<span>nd</span>, 2010</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>People email me frequently and ask the same question over and over again. How can I make social media work for my business? It&#8217;s a great question without a really solid answer. I can&#8217;t give you the exact formula for success, but I can tell you how to fail with Social Media. The formula for that is simple.</p>

<p><strong>How to fail at Social Media Promotion</strong></p>

<p>The best way to fail is to treat it as an afterthought, and blindly sign up for different sites and start spamming your product expecting to double sales overnight. If you treat as just another advertising opportunity, it&#8217;s likely you won&#8217;t get the results you&#8217;re hoping for. Social Media is not just another avenue for advertising, because the audience is already accustomed to ignoring all forms of it. They might follow you or your company out of curiosity, but after a few links they&#8217;re either ignoring you or &#8220;unfollowing&#8221; you altogether.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re selling sprinkler heads online, you may have a small niche market that loves your product. Sprinkler heads are certainly interesting to the right people. But are those people going on to Facebook, Twitter or Digg to find entertaining articles about sprinkler heads? Not likely. They&#8217;re looking to be entertained. They want to meet new people, interact with them and share funny or entertaining things, and the occasional useful item. They&#8217;re more interested in watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq9QJVKR_1Q">a baby eat a watermelon</a> than your great prices on a new line of sprinkler heads.</p>

<p><strong>How do you stand out?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example of doing it right.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.blendtec.com/">Blendtec</a> had an awesome idea to help sell blenders. They invented a persona and created these skits where they started destroying perfectly good pop culture items in their blenders. This was brilliant. Not only is it funny and entertaining, but an excellent demonstration of their products. While you&#8217;re watching these valuable items get destroyed you&#8217;re being introduced to the Blendtec name. This goes to show that you can sell anything online with the right idea.</p>

<p>Blenders are surely mass market items, but had they simply created accounts and started posting links to their product pages they would have had a hard time getting anyones attention let alone sell anything. Instead they are entertaining, people are passing their links around and their blenders are flying off the shelves.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>You have to stand out, get attention and do something nobody else has done before. It&#8217;s tough, and it takes time to come up with the right idea, but once you do it really pays off. Just ask those guys who are using social media to sell blenders.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week google introduced &#8220;go&#8221;, their new programming language. I was curious so I started messing around with it. Here&#8217;s how you can try it out if you&#8217;d like to &#8220;give it a go&#8221;.</p>

<h3>About Google Go</h3>

<p>From <a title="Google Go Homepage" href="http://golang.org" target="_blank">the Go website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
No major systems language has emerged in over a decade, but over that time the computing landscape has changed tremendously. 
There are several trends:
<ul>
    <li>Computers are enormously quicker but software development is not faster.</li>
    <li>Dependency management is a big part of software development today but the &#8220;header files&#8221; of languages in the C tradition are antithetical to clean dependency analysis - and fast compilation.</li>
    <li>There is a growing rebellion against cumbersome type systems like those of Java and C++, pushing people towards dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Some fundamental concepts such as garbage collection and parallel computation are not well supported by popular systems languages.</li>
    <li>The emergence of multicore computers has generated worry and confusion.</li>
</ul>
We believe it&#8217;s worth trying again with a new language, a concurrent, garbage-collected language with fast compilation.
</blockquote>


<p>So I decided to install the GO compiler, so I could play around with it. I found it to be a little different than the instructions.</p>

<h3>Step 1: edit your .bashrc and add these lines:</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Lines to add to .bashrc </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>export GOROOT=$HOME/go
</span><span class='line'>export GOARCH=386
</span><span class='line'>export GOOS=linux
</span><span class='line'>export GOBIN=$HOME/bin
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last two are not listed on the GO site, but I needed them to compile.</p>

<h3>Step 2. Create a bin folder</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mkdir ~/bin
</span><span class='line'>chmod 755 ~/bin
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This was also not included in the instructions, this is so quietgcc has a place to sit, and be run by the installer.</p>

<h3>Step 3. Run the following commands:</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install mercurial
</span><span class='line'>hg clone -r release https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ <span class="nv">$GOROOT</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will pull down the latest copy of go. Next, you&#8217;ll need the libraries to build go:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install bison gcc libc6-dev ed make
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 4: Build and install</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$GOROOT</span>/src
</span><span class='line'>./all.bash
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If all goes well, you&#8217;ll see this screen:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I&#8217;ve been talking a lot with a couple friends about SEO. Both are really smart guys who are trying to break in the web development biz. And naturally they want some help with SEO and getting friends to their site.  And both have mentioned how hard it is to find good information on the net. So I figured I&#8217;d whip up a quick post showing where I get a lot of my info from.</p>

<p>Now of course a lot of my SEO knowledge comes from experience. Either by getting my own sites to rank up for certain terms, or helping my customers succeed. I&#8217;ve been doing this since 1996, so I&#8217;ve learned a lot about that. But I also get a lot of information from other SEOs and marketers, and I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it. So here are some of the places I go to stay &#8220;in the know&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>SEO News - Current Events. </strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s very important to stay current with what&#8217;s going on in the industry. Here are some blogs I check regularly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/">The Matt Cutts Blog</a> - Matt is not only a really smart guy who gives out a lot of info, but he actually works for Google. And he gives you a lot of good information that a &#8220;white hat&#8221; SEO can use to their advantage. While it may not be his intent, he gives out a lot of good info you should listen to.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog">SEOMoz</a> - This is a company blog run by <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/team/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> - Easily one of the top SEOs the world has ever seen. Just a couple hours on this site can improve your knowledge in ways that you won&#8217;t believe. If you are going to focus on one single place to learn about SEO, make this the site to go to.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolf-howl.com/">Gray Wolf&#8217;s blog</a> - This blog being #2 for &#8220;SEO blog&#8221; (SEOMoz is #1)  should tell you Micheal Gray knows his stuff. Another good site that&#8217;s astonishingly free, and full of good info.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.doshdosh.com/">Dosh Dosh</a> - Yes, the name is silly but you remember it. Once you&#8217;ve spend enough time here you can really figure out great ways to make money once your trafic is coming in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seobook.com/blog">SEO Book</a> - Headed by Aaron Wall who is a controversial figure in the industry, there is a lot of great info on this site. You know what they say, if you don&#8217;t have haters, you aren&#8217;t doing it right! Great site, and I&#8217;ve actually read his SEO book front to back. Well worth the investment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While browsing a forum recently, I found a thread that really made me reminisce. Someone has asked about browsing the internet before it was popular, and what it was like. Before the internet was in every home, before we were tweeting or facebooking, instant messaging or watching videos, the internet was a much simpler place.</p>

<p>In 1988 or 89, I remember seeing the &#8220;internet&#8221; for the first time. It was at my buddy Ryan&#8217;s house (RIP) and we were both budding computer nerds, who loved learning about the latest technologies. He had somehow &#8220;acquired&#8221; access to telenet, and we used it to browse bulletin boards all over the country, without paying long distance fees.</p>

<p>There were no graphics, no sound, and no cool videos. There was no &#8220;tweeting&#8221; with your phone, or instantly talking with someone online. It was much simpler, and seems very primitive now. You had to post a message, and wait a couple days for someone to respond. It was a different time for sure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/bbs1.png" title="BBS days" ></p>

<p>I would give nearly anything to relive those days sitting in Ryan&#8217;s house, browsing all over the world reading those crazy text files about telephone switching systems and UNIX servers, drinking mountain dew and eventually going to sleep because the sun had come up, and we knew we&#8217;d be in big trouble if his mom woke up and found us in front of that computer, hacking away.</p>

<p><strong>My First Bulletin Board System (BBS): Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>In the mid 90s, when I was in high school I had decided I was tired of being a spectator, and I wanted to create my own BBS. For those who are unfamiliar, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> was a computer other people could dial into and download files, chat with others, or upload files to. Most of the time a BBS was just a computer in some guy&#8217;s house, and you would find the latest video games, images or whatever you wanted on it. It was not that different from the internet. But most of us didn&#8217;t have internet. So we dialed in over phone lines and connected directly with other computers.</p>

<p>My friend Derrick had introduced me to BBS systems, and showed me a lot about configuring modems (remember init strings and AT commands?) and really got me hooked on these fancy bulletin boards.</p>

<p>Boy, I at 31 I now feel like an old man.</p>

<p>Anyway, at some point I decided to build my own BBS. I saved up my money and bought a 386 16mhz computer (no that&#8217;s not a typo. The computer you&#8217;re reading this page on is probably at least 2,000 mhz, but back then things were much slower) and I built it with the sole purpose of running a bulletin board. I downloaded a shareware copy of &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">Spitfire</a>)&#8221; BBS software, and spent HOURS reading the manual so I could set it up. I purchased a phone line that was dedicated to it, and set it free.</p>

<p>When talking with Ryan, we were trying to come up with a name. I wanted something &#8220;space like&#8221; and cool. Ryan suggested &#8220;Distant Realms&#8221; because it was a place that was far away from normal, and offered something different from the other BBS at the time. Even as a 16 year old kid I knew you had to be different to succeed, and wanted to copy nobody. So we named it &#8220;Distant Realms Online&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The birth of Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>I scoured other boards and downloaded their informational text files on programming, hacking and cracking, and got every shareware video game I could think of. I even hit telenet to see what the East Coast guys had. I stopped at nothing to have the latest and greatest stuff on my board. Remember these?</p>

<ul>
<li>Jazz Jackrabbit</li>
<li>Arctic Adventure</li>
<li>Castle Wolfenstien</li>
<li>Beyond the Titanic</li>
<li>Bio-Menace</li>
<li>Commander Keen</li>
<li>Blake Stone</li>
<li>Crystal Caves</li>
<li>Dark Ages</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on an on. Long story short, I made sure I was the ONLY board in the Portland, Oregon area that had the latest and greatest games, all the time. I really spent a lot of time finding this stuff. I got really competitive with the local boards, and started creating original content just to beat them out. I read about AT&T; Phone systems from tech manuals in the library (hey, the statute of limitations is up I&#8217;ll admit it) and wrote files on how to exploit it. I bought a book on C from Egghead for 40 bucks, learned it and wrote tutorials on it for hours. I wanted to be the best.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/Monochrome_BBS.png" title="BBS Bulleting Board System" ></p>

<p>Within a month or so, I had 50 members of my BBS. I sent out a system message, saying if every one of them donated at least a couple bucks, I could buy the professional version of the software and it would have more features. I ended up with over $120 being sent to me, so I bought the full version of the software.</p>

<p>After that, the member base started building up. Soon I had 300 people coming on to my bulletin board, and I was swamped. I would turn the ringer off on my parent&#8217;s phone and use it as a second phone line. I remember getting bombarded with messages from people saying the lines were always busy. At one point, I had to limit a person&#8217;s time online to 30 minutes, (unless they paid $10 a month for a premium account) just so other people could get in. It was a wildly popular board.</p>

<p><strong>My first lesson in Marketing</strong></p>

<p>That bulletin board taught me a lot. I was a stupid 16 year old kid with a freakish passion for technology, and I was employing good marketing techniques before I even realized what I was doing. I constantly browsed other boards to see if they had something I didn&#8217;t. If they did, I would add it. I still remember spending countless hours trying to compile some neat C program, just so I could could add it to my board and have something nobody else did. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit that much of that stuff was &#8220;hacking&#8221; related, but I was young, dumb and really engaged.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms &#8220;blows up&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>After a while, my BBS started getting really popular. I had donations coming in like crazy. For a while I thought my measly McDonald&#8217;s salary would have to pay for this weird hobby that nobody understood, but donations would come in the mail nearly every other day. I ended up using those funds to purchase software for my board members, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon">Legend of the Red Dragon</a> and other cool software people would use. I had someone on my BBS nearly every hour of the day, and I had so many downloads it wasn&#8217;t funny. It was a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms Online at it&#8217;s peak.</strong></p>

<p>Around 1993, Distant Realms had hundreds of members. People from all over the country were coming to download the latest shareware video games, Hacking and cracking files, and custom C programs I had written for others. People would use the &#8220;chat&#8221; module and exchange information. People would play LORD deep into the hours of the night. Donations ended up purchasing very expensive hard drives, so I had more room to have more stuff.</p>

<p>I remember going into Portland to buy a 28.8 Modem from a computer store for $400. All paid for by donations from my BBS. At the time, that was about 2 weeks salary for me, but I resisted temptation to keep it for myself, and instead buy something to make the BBS cooler. I was one of the first bulletin boards in the Portland Metro area to feature &#8220;Super fast&#8221; 28.8 access. (Hint: Most &#8220;SLOW&#8221; modems now that people rarely use are 56k access).</p>

<p><strong>Who is this kid? </strong></p>

<p>I remember one night getting an invitation to join some other BBS owners in the Portland Area to hang out and get to know each other at the Portland Hilton, in downtown Portland. I decided to go. I dressed up somewhat nice, and took my girlfriend at the time (who had no idea what the hell I was doing with these computers) down there to meet everyone. They were shocked to learn that the owner of one of the biggest and most popular BBS systems in Portland was a pimply-faced teenage kid who drove a POS chevy nova in to meet them. It was really fun talking shop with the other owners, who were in their 20s or 30s, and working in IT.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll never forget how some of those people reacted to the fact that person they were trying so hard to compete with was just some dumb kid. But they were really nice, and I had a lot of fun. I told them how I spent countless hours learning stuff, just so I could put it up on my board for other people to learn.</p>

<p><strong>The eventual death.</strong></p>

<p>Around that time I decided to get a CompuServe account (my first real exposure to the internet). I remember having to beg my parents to put it on their credit card because they didn&#8217;t allow people under 18 to sign up. I used CompuServe to find content to put on my BBS.</p>

<p>But in 1994, I heard of this new way to access the internet, America Online. I signed up for this (I actually signed up so early, I had the email address of jmorgan@aol.com from 1994-1999). Once I discovered the Internet, I knew the BBS would die a slow death. The Internet was just way too cool for the BBS to ever compete, and I knew it. I even wrote an article on my board about &#8220;the death of the BBS is coming&#8221; and a few people didn&#8217;t believe me.</p>

<p>Sometime around the summer of 1996, I was deeply intrigued by the internet, and spent most of my time there. I had created my own cheesy webpage, and was deeply involved with UseNet and AOL groups, and had my attention shifted away from my BBS.</p>

<p>I was 19 years old, and was no longer living at my parent&#8217;s house, but left the computer and phone line there. One day, I decided I wanted the computer that ran Distant Realms Online to try out this new &#8220;Linux&#8221; thing, and decided to go check the spitfire logs. Only about 5 people a day were visiting the BBS (which hadn&#8217;t been updated in months) so I figured it would be a good time to pull the plug. I created a &#8220;goodbye&#8221; message, and came back about a week later and yanked the machine, and shut off the phone line. Distant Realms Online was dead.</p>

<p><strong>I miss the BBS.</strong></p>

<p>Times were much simpler back then. I remember asking my mom to print out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">SpitFire</a>) manual at work, so I could read through and practically memorize the documentation. I remember the hours I spent building the &#8220;perfect article&#8221; to explain buffer overflows in C. I remember dialing into the Library computers (even though I wasn&#8217;t supposed to) and cracking out of the shell just so I could compile and try some new goofy program, ad it was the only way I could find access to a UNIX System V system.</p>

<p>I remember the days fondly of spending hours downloading something, starting it at night, and waking up the next morning to find it, and publish it on my BBS. I remember how nobody in my small town had a clue what I was doing, and how my &#8220;computer class&#8221; teacher used to ask me stuff about what I was doing, out of sheer curiosity. I remember talking with people on my BBS and sending them code to do something, pretending I was an adult who knew what I was doing.</p>

<p>And almost instantly, the internet came along and killed it all. But it was fun while it lasted, and about  year after closing Distant Realms I decided to buy JeremyMorgan.com, and it&#8217;s still here. Still giving out programming advice and trying to help others, still enamored by technology. I miss the BBS, but I&#8217;m glad the Internet has progressed as much as it has. I would have taken me over a year to download Visual Studio Express over a 28.8 modem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wanted to know the secret to getting people to notice you online? How can you get more people reading your blog, following your tweets, or subscribing to your newsletter? How do you position yourself to attract the crowds? The answer might surprise you.</p>

<p>What do all the &#8220;big&#8221; sites have in common? How about the big twitter users? If you really start comparing them, you&#8217;ll find they have a lot less in common than you think. Why is that? Why is there no &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; formula for success? Because if there were, nobody would stand out, and nobody would seem genuine. I&#8217;ll get right to the point.</p>

<blockquote><p>The way to get people to notice you on the internet is no different from real life. You have to be different. You have to be genuine, and most importantly, you have to be&#8230;. you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you feeling a little disappointed at the answer? Let me explain.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the best cross-eyed auto painter I know</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a guy I know who runs an auto painting shop. He has an Albert Einstien haircut, crossed eyes, and his shop sometimes looks like a tornado hit it. He&#8217;s an extremely sloppy man, at least he appears that way. If you were to meet him and look around his shop, he&#8217;d likely be the last person on the planet you&#8217;d ever choose to paint your car.</p>

<p>So, would you be surprised if I told you that people ship their vehicles hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles to have him paint them? And we&#8217;re not talking beat old clunkers, these are immaculate classics to be paraded in car shows all over the country. They don&#8217;t send their cars to him because he&#8217;s the cheapest guy either, in fact far from it. They send them to him because he does such an incredible job that the cars win awards for their paint. The bodywork is flawless, and the paint job is absolutely of the highest quality. Most of the time he&#8217;s backed up for months.</p>

<p><strong>Your imperfections are YOU.</strong></p>

<p>So, do you really think he cares if you think his shop is a mess, or that you won&#8217;t like his crossed eye, or funny haircut? Heck no, if you don&#8217;t like it you can take it somewhere else. The lesson here? He is being himself. He could go and clean up the shop, and make it look like a showroom. He could cut his hair and shave, and show up in a business suit every day. He could move his location to some nice place downtown, and do whatever he could to impress you.  But then he&#8217;d be just like every other shop in town, and his word of mouth advertising would probably drop. After all, what is there to talk about when you&#8217;re just like everyone else?</p>

<p>What he teaches us all is it&#8217;s OK to be yourself. It&#8217;s OK to have flaws and imperfections, as long as you set out to do whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and do it well.  Would you care what this guy looks like, or the condition of his shop when you&#8217;re staring proudly at your sparkling &#8216;57 Chevy at the car show?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be discouraged if your site isn&#8217;t perfect, and doesn&#8217;t have a $10,000 design. Don&#8217;t worry if your writing isn&#8217;t Hemingway, or some of your articles or tweets are duds. Don&#8217;t be afraid to offend people or present something someone else might criticize. Just go out and do it, and give it everything you&#8217;ve got. Have the guts to say &#8220;this is me&#8221; and give 110% into everything you do. Stop caring what other people might think about you.</p>

<p>People will appreciate the sincerity.  Nobody likes to read tweets or blog articles that feel like they&#8217;ve been sterilized and run through a marketing department. They want to read real information from a real human.</p>

<p>Give it a try and tell me about your results!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the design of a product or campaign, most of us strive to create the best product we can create at the time.  This can range from really good quality, to horrible, and it depends on the amount of time, effort and money the creator of the product is willing to spend.</p>

<p>The barriers to building a great product differ greatly. It is significantly easier to build a high quality paperclip than it is to build the fastest computer chip. And I can tell you with great certainty it&#8217;s difficult and costly to build a good 4G WiMAX service too. But <a href="http://www.clear.com">Clear Communications</a> managed to do just that.</p>

<p>Clear built a fantastic product, which is a wireless internet solution surrounding the Portland area (<a href="http://www.clear.com/future_is_clear.php">WiMAX</a>). This product enables nomadic internet browsing all over the countryside, and I love being able to check my email while driving down the freeway. In fact, with the speeds I get from it, I could watch a movie on Netflix while driving down the highway (I bet that thought makes you a little uncomfortable).</p>

<p>The coverage is better than they said it would be. They told me I wouldn&#8217;t get a connection at my house, which is a ways south of Portland. I consistently get a 1-2 meg connection from home. They advertise speeds of up to 6mb, and I get that almost everywhere. So I get more than I was actually promised. It&#8217;s a fantastic product, and well worth what I pay for it. But I won&#8217;t be recommending it to anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Great Product, frustrating service</strong></p>

<p>My frustration with Clear started early. I won&#8217;t go into great detail, but I was promised a discount on it, (I work for the company who developed the technology for it), and never received the discount. After 6 months, I still haven&#8217;t, and probably never will.</p>

<p>There was a referral program, where if I refer customers I get a 25$ gift card. That was the most nightmarish process I have ever been through for a referral, with all kinds of back and forth, 5 phone calls, numerous emails, 3 days, and having to get someone&#8217;s social security number to get credit for the referral.  I&#8217;m really surprised my friend went through all that hassle to sign up. I never got the $25 gift card.</p>

<p>As a part of the package, I was given this neat little USB modem to connect to the service. Worked great until I bought a new PC, and couldn&#8217;t find the driver disk. I called clear, and they told me to go to their website. I go there, and download the Clear connection utility. But no driver for the modem.</p>

<p>I called back again and was told to go to their site. I explained that I still needed a driver, and was told to go to Motorola. I went to their site, and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Product+Lines/MOTOwi4/USBw_100_US-EN">found the modem</a> but their page has no driver download. I called Motorola, and they have never heard of the product.  After sending them the link to their site and doing some wrangling, I find out that 3 separate companies developed the product. None of them have a driver, and I was told: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to contact Clear&#8221;.</p>

<p>A lot of frustration, especially considering I&#8217;m probably working in the same building where the driver was developed in the first place. This driver is nearly impossible to find.</p>

<p>Long story short I pay for a product that sits unused because I was stupid enough to lose the golden CD that guarantees access to the service. I&#8217;m going to go searching through my house and try to find that magical CD, and hopefully get back on the road again. Now, keep in mind I&#8217;m a technical person. Imagine the frustration of the average Joe trying to get this stuff worked out?</p>

<p>Moral of the Story: A great product is something to strive for.  However, a great product isn&#8217;t enough if your user experience sucks. What good is it to have a product that everyone is silently using? If they took as much care into customer service as they did in building the technology, I&#8217;d be a walking advertising machine for them, instead I&#8217;m referring nobody, and even complaining about them on my blog.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-07-07T22:45:21+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 7<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started selling some software to add followers on Twitter. A couple  of customers have asked me &#8220;why am I not getting a lot of followers?&#8221;, and some potential buyers have had the same complaint, saying they purchased adders in the past that didn&#8217;t perform well, so they won&#8217;t be purchasing mine. I think I know the answer to this.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/shrugging.jpg" alt="Need friends on twitter?" />The answer goes back to some simple questions. &#8220;Who am I marketing to&#8221; and &#8220;what do they want to see?&#8221;. All twitter follower adders rely on a similar concept. You follow someone, and they may or may not follow you back. Most people look at a profile when someone follows them, and decides whether or not to reciprocate. The factors they use to make this decision are obvious: Why would they want to follow you?</p>

<p>When is the last time you found a profile on twitter of a cute 20 something girl in a skimpy outfit who posted 20 tweets a day that were all links to dating sites and decided you just had to follow her? I&#8217;m guessing it doesn&#8217;t happen much. And that&#8217;s my point, people will only follow you if you&#8217;re interesting.</p>

<p>Am I saying you shouldn&#8217;t try selling your product on twitter? Of course not. But you have to mix it up. A good combination of personal tweets (yes, what you had for lunch or a cool song you&#8217;re listening to) dialog with other twitterers, and links to other cool stuff as well. Posting a lot of links isn&#8217;t a big deal if they are mostly interesting valuable links from different places. Mix your own links in and you can get a good thing going. Post some jokes or funny quotes.</p>

<p>The bottom line: people want to follow you, not your company. They want to know they&#8217;re interacting with an actual human being who has something valuable to provide. If you&#8217;re getting into twitter marketing just to spam, you&#8217;ll be ignored as spam. If you get into it to meet and interact with your customers, and have a little fun in the process, you&#8217;ll find a lot more success.</p>
