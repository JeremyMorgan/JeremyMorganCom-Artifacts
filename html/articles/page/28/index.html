  <div class="entry-content"><p>You stroll into a restaurant, get seated at your table, chatting with friends. You bring up your mobile phone and load up Foursquare, GoWalla, or Facebook Places and &#8220;Check in&#8221;. Now all your contacts on these networks and/or your Facebook friends know you are enjoying a nice orange chicken at P.F. Chang&#8217;s. But does anyone really care? And as a marketer, do you really care about the people who are doing this?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service">Location Based Services</a> are popping up all over, and gaining in popularity. Foursquare is rumored to  be a<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/22/foursquare-growth/">dding 100,000 users a week</a>. Gowalla, a close second, is planning <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/02/technology/Gowalla_integrates_foursquare/">some major changes</a> in it&#8217;s next release that could lead to them catching up rather quickly.  And of course <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/19/facebook-places-features-_n_687504.html#s128538">Facebook Places</a> has made a huge splash due to the popularity of Facebook in general, something people are already on with their mobile phone anyway. So is this the next big thing, or a silly fad? Nobody truly knows the answer, but people are certainly giving it a try.</p>

<p><strong>Location Based Services are Fun, and Useful</strong></p>

<p>I use both Foursquare and Facebook Places to &#8220;check in&#8221; to certain spots. Even though I know a significant amount of my social network couldn&#8217;t care less, there are some that do. I&#8217;ll give you some examples.</p>

<p><strong>At work:</strong> I work from home frequently. But when I&#8217;m in the office, it&#8217;s helpful for my coworkers to know I&#8217;m there, on site. When I &#8220;check in&#8221; those coworkers who are Facebook friends (a significant amount) know I&#8217;m there and know they can go looking around the office to find me for a face to face question, or just to say hi.</p>

<p><strong>At the Fire Department: </strong>I&#8217;m a volunteer firefighter, so I can answer calls at my own whim, but nobody really knows for sure whether I&#8217;ll be there for the next call. However, if I happen to be hanging out at the fire station, and I check in, my fellow firefighters who are on my Facebook know I&#8217;m there and will be available if there is a call. Most of my Lieutenants are on Facebook and it&#8217;s helpful for them to know this information in case something happens. They also know if I&#8217;m far out of town and <em>won&#8217;t</em> be available if a call comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Socially:</strong> When I check in at a restaurant or a local pub, it&#8217;s an announcement that I&#8217;m there, but also an invitation for my buddies to join me. It&#8217;s a good way to start an informal gathering. Also, it&#8217;s a conversation piece and a chance to tell them about a place they haven&#8217;t been. &#8220;Hey Jeremy, I saw you were at _____ the other day, is that place any good?&#8221; As someone who loves to visit ethnic restaurants and sports bars, it&#8217;s a good chance to introduce my friends to something new.</p>

<p><strong>What&#8217;s the point? </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/friends1.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/friends1-300x260.jpg" alt="" /></a>So if you&#8217;re asking yourself, &#8220;what&#8217;s the point of these check-in services?&#8221; I just gave a few personal examples of why I use it. And many people use them for similar reasons and more. My point: there are some actual useful reasons for using services like this other than pointless &#8220;what I&#8217;m having for breakfast&#8221; type of thing. That&#8217;s why these services are catching on.</p>

<p>Ironically the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; in social networking seems to be real life networking as opposed to friends that exist purely on the internet. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter and other services expanded your circle of friends nationally and internationally, and these services are bringing your circle back to your local area. It&#8217;s a bit of a concept shift, but not a big surprise things have come full circle like this.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of these?</strong></p>

<p>If I know my audience well enough, I would say that only about 20% of you can really take advantage of these services as a marketer (directly). In my research I&#8217;ve found that 20% of my readers are affiliated with a brick and mortar type business. And out of that 20% most of them are not &#8220;walk in&#8221; type places that would even be registered on Foursquare or Facebook places. That doesn&#8217;t mean you should ignore these services however. You should still sign up, register your business and use it to see what your customers are doing. See what they like, where they like to go and what they like to do. This may give you some insight into how you can make YOUR product or service better meet their needs.</p>

<p>For those businesses who would likely be featured on a LBS, such as Restaurants, Bars, Dance Clubs, Pool Halls and the like you have an excellent opportunity to reach out to new and existing customers now. The idea is simple: offer rewards to those who check in frequently. I&#8217;ll give you an example: <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/2251751">Ballad Town Billiards</a>, a pool hall in Forest Grove has a special offer: Free pool for the mayor. This simple offer serves two purposes: people show up often so they can become mayor, and people check in frequently which is essentially an advertisement for their venue. The more people they have checking in trying to become mayor, the more people are seeing their name plastered on Foursquare and Facebook, which is free advertising. Do you really think giving someone free pool is a high price to pay for that much exposure? Hardly.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>Whether or not this &#8220;check in&#8221; thing is a fad that will go away, or the next big step in social life is unclear at this point. But you can capitalize on it as a marketer in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>See what your customer base or niche is interested in, where they are going and what they&#8217;re doing</p></li>
<li><p>Interact with your customers, see what they&#8217;re saying and how you&#8217;re perceived through reviews</p></li>
<li><p>Use incentives to get people to talk about your business and get them come in</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sounds like a lot of opportunity from a free service. Think about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many of you likely read the &#8221;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all">Decor my Eyes</a>&#8221; horror story earlier this week. And I&#8217;m guessing most if not all of you read that and got upset. Gaming the search engines is for nefarious purposes is bad enough, but gaming the search engine by <em>using</em> nefarious tactics is even worse. So that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m thrilled to post the happy ending to this story.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/search.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/search.jpg" alt="Decor my eyes Google " /></a>
The short story is Clarabelle Rodriguez bought some glasses from a company that was ranked high in Google for the brand of eyeglasses she was seeking. She had a bad experience with the company and had her bank stop the transaction. She was allegedly met with threats of various types, and harassment until she made the payment go through. Then someone from the company allegedly called her bank and got the transaction to go through.</p>

<p>Furious with this treatment, she started putting out bad reviews. As it turns out, this is exactly what the owner of the company wanted.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“Hello, My name is Stanley with DecorMyEyes.com,” the post began. “I just wanted to let you guys know that the more replies you people post, the more business and the more hits and sales I get. My goal is NEGATIVE advertisement.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>As it turns out, negative publicity and back links from reviews (even bad reviews) were driving up his google rank like crazy. As this story made it around the internet, Google got wind of it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“We were horrified to read about Ms. Rodriguez’s dreadful experience. Even though our initial analysis pointed to this being an edge case and not a widespread problem in our search results, we immediately convened a team that looked carefully at the issue. That team developed an initial algorithmic solution, implemented it, and the solution is already live. I am here to tell you that being bad is, and hopefully will always be, bad for business in Google’s search results.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Source: <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/being-bad-to-your-customers-is-bad-for.html">Google Blog</a></p>

<p>So the moral of the story here is clear:  the golden rule applies to business, and if you&#8217;re scamming, cheating or treating people badly it will catch up with you. It&#8217;s really nice to see Google step up and take care of this so quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The &#8220;hello world&#8221; app is always the first thing most students do in any language. Java is no different, and I&#8217;ll show you how easy it is here.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/rtknqrUbq6M">Java Tutorial - Hello World</a></p>

<p>This tutorial makes a few assumptions. We&#8217;ve assumed that you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">installed the JDK</a> and have it running. For this tutorial I&#8217;m using Ubuntu Linux at the command line, but the code is the same if you&#8217;re using Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create File </strong></p>

<p>Create a file called &#8220;HelloWorld.java&#8221;. In there type the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HelloWorld</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code is pretty self explanatory. We&#8217;re creating a class called &#8220;HelloWorld&#8221;. When that class executes the first thing that runs is the main() method. Within that method we have a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/System.html">System.out.println</a> method that outputs text.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: compile</strong></p>

<p>To compile this, we simply type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>javac HelloWorld.java</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This compiles into a file named HelloWorld.class</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Run</strong></p>

<p>To run this file, we type in:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>java HelloWorld</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And it outputs text. It&#8217;s that easy!</p>

<p>Now find some ways to make text output interesting. There are thousands of cool things you can do at the console.</p>

<time datetime="2010-07-22T10:46:44+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 22<span>nd</span>, 2010</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People email me frequently and ask the same question over and over again. How can I make social media work for my business? It&#8217;s a great question without a really solid answer. I can&#8217;t give you the exact formula for success, but I can tell you how to fail with Social Media. The formula for that is simple.</p>

<p><strong>How to fail at Social Media Promotion</strong></p>

<p>The best way to fail is to treat it as an afterthought, and blindly sign up for different sites and start spamming your product expecting to double sales overnight. If you treat as just another advertising opportunity, it&#8217;s likely you won&#8217;t get the results you&#8217;re hoping for. Social Media is not just another avenue for advertising, because the audience is already accustomed to ignoring all forms of it. They might follow you or your company out of curiosity, but after a few links they&#8217;re either ignoring you or &#8220;unfollowing&#8221; you altogether.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re selling sprinkler heads online, you may have a small niche market that loves your product. Sprinkler heads are certainly interesting to the right people. But are those people going on to Facebook, Twitter or Digg to find entertaining articles about sprinkler heads? Not likely. They&#8217;re looking to be entertained. They want to meet new people, interact with them and share funny or entertaining things, and the occasional useful item. They&#8217;re more interested in watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq9QJVKR_1Q">a baby eat a watermelon</a> than your great prices on a new line of sprinkler heads.</p>

<p><strong>How do you stand out?</strong></p>

<p>Here is an example of doing it right.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="http://www.blendtec.com/">Blendtec</a> had an awesome idea to help sell blenders. They invented a persona and created these skits where they started destroying perfectly good pop culture items in their blenders. This was brilliant. Not only is it funny and entertaining, but an excellent demonstration of their products. While you&#8217;re watching these valuable items get destroyed you&#8217;re being introduced to the Blendtec name. This goes to show that you can sell anything online with the right idea.</p>

<p>Blenders are surely mass market items, but had they simply created accounts and started posting links to their product pages they would have had a hard time getting anyones attention let alone sell anything. Instead they are entertaining, people are passing their links around and their blenders are flying off the shelves.</p>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>You have to stand out, get attention and do something nobody else has done before. It&#8217;s tough, and it takes time to come up with the right idea, but once you do it really pays off. Just ask those guys who are using social media to sell blenders.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week google introduced &#8220;go&#8221;, their new programming language. I was curious so I started messing around with it. Here&#8217;s how you can try it out if you&#8217;d like to &#8220;give it a go&#8221;.</p>

<h3>About Google Go</h3>

<p>From <a title="Google Go Homepage" href="http://golang.org" target="_blank">the Go website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
No major systems language has emerged in over a decade, but over that time the computing landscape has changed tremendously. 
There are several trends:
<ul>
    <li>Computers are enormously quicker but software development is not faster.</li>
    <li>Dependency management is a big part of software development today but the &#8220;header files&#8221; of languages in the C tradition are antithetical to clean dependency analysis - and fast compilation.</li>
    <li>There is a growing rebellion against cumbersome type systems like those of Java and C++, pushing people towards dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript.</li>
    <li>Some fundamental concepts such as garbage collection and parallel computation are not well supported by popular systems languages.</li>
    <li>The emergence of multicore computers has generated worry and confusion.</li>
</ul>
We believe it&#8217;s worth trying again with a new language, a concurrent, garbage-collected language with fast compilation.
</blockquote>


<p>So I decided to install the GO compiler, so I could play around with it. I found it to be a little different than the instructions.</p>

<h3>Step 1: edit your .bashrc and add these lines:</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Lines to add to .bashrc </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>export GOROOT=$HOME/go
</span><span class='line'>export GOARCH=386
</span><span class='line'>export GOOS=linux
</span><span class='line'>export GOBIN=$HOME/bin
</span><span class='line'>export PATH=$GOBIN:$PATH</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last two are not listed on the GO site, but I needed them to compile.</p>

<h3>Step 2. Create a bin folder</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>mkdir ~/bin
</span><span class='line'>chmod 755 ~/bin
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This was also not included in the instructions, this is so quietgcc has a place to sit, and be run by the installer.</p>

<h3>Step 3. Run the following commands:</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install mercurial
</span><span class='line'>hg clone -r release https://go.googlecode.com/hg/ <span class="nv">$GOROOT</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will pull down the latest copy of go. Next, you&#8217;ll need the libraries to build go:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install bison gcc libc6-dev ed make
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 4: Build and install</h3>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$GOROOT</span>/src
</span><span class='line'>./all.bash
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If all goes well, you&#8217;ll see this screen:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I&#8217;ve been talking a lot with a couple friends about SEO. Both are really smart guys who are trying to break in the web development biz. And naturally they want some help with SEO and getting friends to their site.  And both have mentioned how hard it is to find good information on the net. So I figured I&#8217;d whip up a quick post showing where I get a lot of my info from.</p>

<p>Now of course a lot of my SEO knowledge comes from experience. Either by getting my own sites to rank up for certain terms, or helping my customers succeed. I&#8217;ve been doing this since 1996, so I&#8217;ve learned a lot about that. But I also get a lot of information from other SEOs and marketers, and I&#8217;m not afraid to admit it. So here are some of the places I go to stay &#8220;in the know&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>SEO News - Current Events. </strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s very important to stay current with what&#8217;s going on in the industry. Here are some blogs I check regularly.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/">The Matt Cutts Blog</a> - Matt is not only a really smart guy who gives out a lot of info, but he actually works for Google. And he gives you a lot of good information that a &#8220;white hat&#8221; SEO can use to their advantage. While it may not be his intent, he gives out a lot of good info you should listen to.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog">SEOMoz</a> - This is a company blog run by <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/team/randfish">Rand Fishkin</a> - Easily one of the top SEOs the world has ever seen. Just a couple hours on this site can improve your knowledge in ways that you won&#8217;t believe. If you are going to focus on one single place to learn about SEO, make this the site to go to.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolf-howl.com/">Gray Wolf&#8217;s blog</a> - This blog being #2 for &#8220;SEO blog&#8221; (SEOMoz is #1)  should tell you Micheal Gray knows his stuff. Another good site that&#8217;s astonishingly free, and full of good info.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.doshdosh.com/">Dosh Dosh</a> - Yes, the name is silly but you remember it. Once you&#8217;ve spend enough time here you can really figure out great ways to make money once your trafic is coming in.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seobook.com/blog">SEO Book</a> - Headed by Aaron Wall who is a controversial figure in the industry, there is a lot of great info on this site. You know what they say, if you don&#8217;t have haters, you aren&#8217;t doing it right! Great site, and I&#8217;ve actually read his SEO book front to back. Well worth the investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailyseoblog.com/"> Daily SEO Blog</a> - This is a great site with a lot of great info. I would highly reccomend checking it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, these are some good daily reads, but there is a lot more out there. I will post them, and in the next post I will talk about some SEO tools that you need to succeed. This will end up being a series of articles that I think will really help people out. See you then!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While browsing a forum recently, I found a thread that really made me reminisce. Someone has asked about browsing the internet before it was popular, and what it was like. Before the internet was in every home, before we were tweeting or facebooking, instant messaging or watching videos, the internet was a much simpler place.</p>

<p>In 1988 or 89, I remember seeing the &#8220;internet&#8221; for the first time. It was at my buddy Ryan&#8217;s house (RIP) and we were both budding computer nerds, who loved learning about the latest technologies. He had somehow &#8220;acquired&#8221; access to telenet, and we used it to browse bulletin boards all over the country, without paying long distance fees.</p>

<p>There were no graphics, no sound, and no cool videos. There was no &#8220;tweeting&#8221; with your phone, or instantly talking with someone online. It was much simpler, and seems very primitive now. You had to post a message, and wait a couple days for someone to respond. It was a different time for sure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/bbs1.png" title="BBS days" ></p>

<p>I would give nearly anything to relive those days sitting in Ryan&#8217;s house, browsing all over the world reading those crazy text files about telephone switching systems and UNIX servers, drinking mountain dew and eventually going to sleep because the sun had come up, and we knew we&#8217;d be in big trouble if his mom woke up and found us in front of that computer, hacking away.</p>

<p><strong>My First Bulletin Board System (BBS): Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>In the mid 90s, when I was in high school I had decided I was tired of being a spectator, and I wanted to create my own BBS. For those who are unfamiliar, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> was a computer other people could dial into and download files, chat with others, or upload files to. Most of the time a BBS was just a computer in some guy&#8217;s house, and you would find the latest video games, images or whatever you wanted on it. It was not that different from the internet. But most of us didn&#8217;t have internet. So we dialed in over phone lines and connected directly with other computers.</p>

<p>My friend Derrick had introduced me to BBS systems, and showed me a lot about configuring modems (remember init strings and AT commands?) and really got me hooked on these fancy bulletin boards.</p>

<p>Boy, I at 31 I now feel like an old man.</p>

<p>Anyway, at some point I decided to build my own BBS. I saved up my money and bought a 386 16mhz computer (no that&#8217;s not a typo. The computer you&#8217;re reading this page on is probably at least 2,000 mhz, but back then things were much slower) and I built it with the sole purpose of running a bulletin board. I downloaded a shareware copy of &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">Spitfire</a>)&#8221; BBS software, and spent HOURS reading the manual so I could set it up. I purchased a phone line that was dedicated to it, and set it free.</p>

<p>When talking with Ryan, we were trying to come up with a name. I wanted something &#8220;space like&#8221; and cool. Ryan suggested &#8220;Distant Realms&#8221; because it was a place that was far away from normal, and offered something different from the other BBS at the time. Even as a 16 year old kid I knew you had to be different to succeed, and wanted to copy nobody. So we named it &#8220;Distant Realms Online&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The birth of Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>I scoured other boards and downloaded their informational text files on programming, hacking and cracking, and got every shareware video game I could think of. I even hit telenet to see what the East Coast guys had. I stopped at nothing to have the latest and greatest stuff on my board. Remember these?</p>

<ul>
<li>Jazz Jackrabbit</li>
<li>Arctic Adventure</li>
<li>Castle Wolfenstien</li>
<li>Beyond the Titanic</li>
<li>Bio-Menace</li>
<li>Commander Keen</li>
<li>Blake Stone</li>
<li>Crystal Caves</li>
<li>Dark Ages</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on an on. Long story short, I made sure I was the ONLY board in the Portland, Oregon area that had the latest and greatest games, all the time. I really spent a lot of time finding this stuff. I got really competitive with the local boards, and started creating original content just to beat them out. I read about AT&T; Phone systems from tech manuals in the library (hey, the statute of limitations is up I&#8217;ll admit it) and wrote files on how to exploit it. I bought a book on C from Egghead for 40 bucks, learned it and wrote tutorials on it for hours. I wanted to be the best.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/Monochrome_BBS.png" title="BBS Bulleting Board System" ></p>

<p>Within a month or so, I had 50 members of my BBS. I sent out a system message, saying if every one of them donated at least a couple bucks, I could buy the professional version of the software and it would have more features. I ended up with over $120 being sent to me, so I bought the full version of the software.</p>

<p>After that, the member base started building up. Soon I had 300 people coming on to my bulletin board, and I was swamped. I would turn the ringer off on my parent&#8217;s phone and use it as a second phone line. I remember getting bombarded with messages from people saying the lines were always busy. At one point, I had to limit a person&#8217;s time online to 30 minutes, (unless they paid $10 a month for a premium account) just so other people could get in. It was a wildly popular board.</p>

<p><strong>My first lesson in Marketing</strong></p>

<p>That bulletin board taught me a lot. I was a stupid 16 year old kid with a freakish passion for technology, and I was employing good marketing techniques before I even realized what I was doing. I constantly browsed other boards to see if they had something I didn&#8217;t. If they did, I would add it. I still remember spending countless hours trying to compile some neat C program, just so I could could add it to my board and have something nobody else did. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit that much of that stuff was &#8220;hacking&#8221; related, but I was young, dumb and really engaged.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms &#8220;blows up&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>After a while, my BBS started getting really popular. I had donations coming in like crazy. For a while I thought my measly McDonald&#8217;s salary would have to pay for this weird hobby that nobody understood, but donations would come in the mail nearly every other day. I ended up using those funds to purchase software for my board members, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon">Legend of the Red Dragon</a> and other cool software people would use. I had someone on my BBS nearly every hour of the day, and I had so many downloads it wasn&#8217;t funny. It was a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms Online at it&#8217;s peak.</strong></p>

<p>Around 1993, Distant Realms had hundreds of members. People from all over the country were coming to download the latest shareware video games, Hacking and cracking files, and custom C programs I had written for others. People would use the &#8220;chat&#8221; module and exchange information. People would play LORD deep into the hours of the night. Donations ended up purchasing very expensive hard drives, so I had more room to have more stuff.</p>

<p>I remember going into Portland to buy a 28.8 Modem from a computer store for $400. All paid for by donations from my BBS. At the time, that was about 2 weeks salary for me, but I resisted temptation to keep it for myself, and instead buy something to make the BBS cooler. I was one of the first bulletin boards in the Portland Metro area to feature &#8220;Super fast&#8221; 28.8 access. (Hint: Most &#8220;SLOW&#8221; modems now that people rarely use are 56k access).</p>

<p><strong>Who is this kid? </strong></p>

<p>I remember one night getting an invitation to join some other BBS owners in the Portland Area to hang out and get to know each other at the Portland Hilton, in downtown Portland. I decided to go. I dressed up somewhat nice, and took my girlfriend at the time (who had no idea what the hell I was doing with these computers) down there to meet everyone. They were shocked to learn that the owner of one of the biggest and most popular BBS systems in Portland was a pimply-faced teenage kid who drove a POS chevy nova in to meet them. It was really fun talking shop with the other owners, who were in their 20s or 30s, and working in IT.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll never forget how some of those people reacted to the fact that person they were trying so hard to compete with was just some dumb kid. But they were really nice, and I had a lot of fun. I told them how I spent countless hours learning stuff, just so I could put it up on my board for other people to learn.</p>

<p><strong>The eventual death.</strong></p>

<p>Around that time I decided to get a CompuServe account (my first real exposure to the internet). I remember having to beg my parents to put it on their credit card because they didn&#8217;t allow people under 18 to sign up. I used CompuServe to find content to put on my BBS.</p>

<p>But in 1994, I heard of this new way to access the internet, America Online. I signed up for this (I actually signed up so early, I had the email address of jmorgan@aol.com from 1994-1999). Once I discovered the Internet, I knew the BBS would die a slow death. The Internet was just way too cool for the BBS to ever compete, and I knew it. I even wrote an article on my board about &#8220;the death of the BBS is coming&#8221; and a few people didn&#8217;t believe me.</p>

<p>Sometime around the summer of 1996, I was deeply intrigued by the internet, and spent most of my time there. I had created my own cheesy webpage, and was deeply involved with UseNet and AOL groups, and had my attention shifted away from my BBS.</p>

<p>I was 19 years old, and was no longer living at my parent&#8217;s house, but left the computer and phone line there. One day, I decided I wanted the computer that ran Distant Realms Online to try out this new &#8220;Linux&#8221; thing, and decided to go check the spitfire logs. Only about 5 people a day were visiting the BBS (which hadn&#8217;t been updated in months) so I figured it would be a good time to pull the plug. I created a &#8220;goodbye&#8221; message, and came back about a week later and yanked the machine, and shut off the phone line. Distant Realms Online was dead.</p>

<p><strong>I miss the BBS.</strong></p>

<p>Times were much simpler back then. I remember asking my mom to print out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">SpitFire</a>) manual at work, so I could read through and practically memorize the documentation.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While browsing a forum recently, I found a thread that really made me reminisce. Someone has asked about browsing the internet before it was popular, and what it was like. Before the internet was in every home, before we were tweeting or facebooking, instant messaging or watching videos, the internet was a much simpler place.</p>

<p>In 1988 or 89, I remember seeing the &#8220;internet&#8221; for the first time. It was at my buddy Ryan&#8217;s house (RIP) and we were both budding computer nerds, who loved learning about the latest technologies. He had somehow &#8220;acquired&#8221; access to telenet, and we used it to browse bulletin boards all over the country, without paying long distance fees.</p>

<p>There were no graphics, no sound, and no cool videos. There was no &#8220;tweeting&#8221; with your phone, or instantly talking with someone online. It was much simpler, and seems very primitive now. You had to post a message, and wait a couple days for someone to respond. It was a different time for sure.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/bbs1.png" title="BBS days" ></p>

<p>I would give nearly anything to relive those days sitting in Ryan&#8217;s house, browsing all over the world reading those crazy text files about telephone switching systems and UNIX servers, drinking mountain dew and eventually going to sleep because the sun had come up, and we knew we&#8217;d be in big trouble if his mom woke up and found us in front of that computer, hacking away.</p>

<p><strong>My First Bulletin Board System (BBS): Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>In the mid 90s, when I was in high school I had decided I was tired of being a spectator, and I wanted to create my own BBS. For those who are unfamiliar, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS</a> was a computer other people could dial into and download files, chat with others, or upload files to. Most of the time a BBS was just a computer in some guy&#8217;s house, and you would find the latest video games, images or whatever you wanted on it. It was not that different from the internet. But most of us didn&#8217;t have internet. So we dialed in over phone lines and connected directly with other computers.</p>

<p>My friend Derrick had introduced me to BBS systems, and showed me a lot about configuring modems (remember init strings and AT commands?) and really got me hooked on these fancy bulletin boards.</p>

<p>Boy, I at 31 I now feel like an old man.</p>

<p>Anyway, at some point I decided to build my own BBS. I saved up my money and bought a 386 16mhz computer (no that&#8217;s not a typo. The computer you&#8217;re reading this page on is probably at least 2,000 mhz, but back then things were much slower) and I built it with the sole purpose of running a bulletin board. I downloaded a shareware copy of &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">Spitfire</a>)&#8221; BBS software, and spent HOURS reading the manual so I could set it up. I purchased a phone line that was dedicated to it, and set it free.</p>

<p>When talking with Ryan, we were trying to come up with a name. I wanted something &#8220;space like&#8221; and cool. Ryan suggested &#8220;Distant Realms&#8221; because it was a place that was far away from normal, and offered something different from the other BBS at the time. Even as a 16 year old kid I knew you had to be different to succeed, and wanted to copy nobody. So we named it &#8220;Distant Realms Online&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>The birth of Distant Realms Online</strong></p>

<p>I scoured other boards and downloaded their informational text files on programming, hacking and cracking, and got every shareware video game I could think of. I even hit telenet to see what the East Coast guys had. I stopped at nothing to have the latest and greatest stuff on my board. Remember these?</p>

<p>Jazz Jackrabbit
Arctic Adventure
Castle Wolfenstien
Beyond the Titanic
Bio-Menace
Commander Keen
Blake Stone
Crystal Caves
Dark Ages</p>

<p>I could go on an on. Long story short, I made sure I was the ONLY board in the Portland, Oregon area that had the latest and greatest games, all the time. I really spent a lot of time finding this stuff. I got really competitive with the local boards, and started creating original content just to beat them out. I read about AT&T; Phone systems from tech manuals in the library (hey, the statute of limitations is up I&#8217;ll admit it) and wrote files on how to exploit it. I bought a book on C from Egghead for 40 bucks, learned it and wrote tutorials on it for hours. I wanted to be the best.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/Monochrome_BBS.png" title="BBS Bulleting Board System" ></p>

<p>Within a month or so, I had 50 members of my BBS. I sent out a system message, saying if every one of them donated at least a couple bucks, I could buy the professional version of the software and it would have more features. I ended up with over $120 being sent to me, so I bought the full version of the software.</p>

<p>After that, the member base started building up. Soon I had 300 people coming on to my bulletin board, and I was swamped. I would turn the ringer off on my parent&#8217;s phone and use it as a second phone line. I remember getting bombarded with messages from people saying the lines were always busy. At one point, I had to limit a person&#8217;s time online to 30 minutes, (unless they paid $10 a month for a premium account) just so other people could get in. It was a wildly popular board.</p>

<p><strong>My first lesson in Marketing</strong></p>

<p>That bulletin board taught me a lot. I was a stupid 16 year old kid with a freakish passion for technology, and I was employing good marketing techniques before I even realized what I was doing. I constantly browsed other boards to see if they had something I didn&#8217;t. If they did, I would add it. I still remember spending countless hours trying to compile some neat C program, just so I could could add it to my board and have something nobody else did. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit that much of that stuff was &#8220;hacking&#8221; related, but I was young, dumb and really engaged.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms &#8220;blows up&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>After a while, my BBS started getting really popular. I had donations coming in like crazy. For a while I thought my measly McDonald&#8217;s salary would have to pay for this weird hobby that nobody understood, but donations would come in the mail nearly every other day. I ended up using those funds to purchase software for my board members, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Red_Dragon">Legend of the Red Dragon</a> and other cool software people would use. I had someone on my BBS nearly every hour of the day, and I had so many downloads it wasn&#8217;t funny. It was a blast.</p>

<p><strong>Distant Realms Online at it&#8217;s peak.</strong></p>

<p>Around 1993, Distant Realms had hundreds of members. People from all over the country were coming to download the latest shareware video games, Hacking and cracking files, and custom C programs I had written for others. People would use the &#8220;chat&#8221; module and exchange information. People would play LORD deep into the hours of the night. Donations ended up purchasing very expensive hard drives, so I had more room to have more stuff.</p>

<p>I remember going into Portland to buy a 28.8 Modem from a computer store for $400. All paid for by donations from my BBS. At the time, that was about 2 weeks salary for me, but I resisted temptation to keep it for myself, and instead buy something to make the BBS cooler. I was one of the first bulletin boards in the Portland Metro area to feature &#8220;Super fast&#8221; 28.8 access. (Hint: Most &#8220;SLOW&#8221; modems now that people rarely use are 56k access).</p>

<p><strong>Who is this kid? </strong></p>

<p>I remember one night getting an invitation to join some other BBS owners in the Portland Area to hang out and get to know each other at the Portland Hilton, in downtown Portland. I decided to go. I dressed up somewhat nice, and took my girlfriend at the time (who had no idea what the hell I was doing with these computers) down there to meet everyone. They were shocked to learn that the owner of one of the biggest and most popular BBS systems in Portland was a pimply-faced teenage kid who drove a POS chevy nova in to meet them. It was really fun talking shop with the other owners, who were in their 20s or 30s, and working in IT.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll never forget how some of those people reacted to the fact that person they were trying so hard to compete with was just some dumb kid. But they were really nice, and I had a lot of fun. I told them how I spent countless hours learning stuff, just so I could put it up on my board for other people to learn.</p>

<p><strong>The eventual death.</strong></p>

<p>Around that time I decided to get a CompuServe account (my first real exposure to the internet). I remember having to beg my parents to put it on their credit card because they didn&#8217;t allow people under 18 to sign up. I used CompuServe to find content to put on my BBS.</p>

<p>But in 1994, I heard of this new way to access the internet, America Online. I signed up for this (I actually signed up so early, I had the email address of jmorgan@aol.com from 1994-1999). Once I discovered the Internet, I knew the BBS would die a slow death. The Internet was just way too cool for the BBS to ever compete, and I knew it. I even wrote an article on my board about &#8220;the death of the BBS is coming&#8221; and a few people didn&#8217;t believe me.</p>

<p>Sometime around the summer of 1996, I was deeply intrigued by the internet, and spent most of my time there. I had created my own cheesy webpage, and was deeply involved with UseNet and AOL groups, and had my attention shifted away from my BBS.</p>

<p>I was 19 years old, and was no longer living at my parent&#8217;s house, but left the computer and phone line there. One day, I decided I wanted the computer that ran Distant Realms Online to try out this new &#8220;Linux&#8221; thing, and decided to go check the spitfire logs. Only about 5 people a day were visiting the BBS (which hadn&#8217;t been updated in months) so I figured it would be a good time to pull the plug. I created a &#8220;goodbye&#8221; message, and came back about a week later and yanked the machine, and shut off the phone line. Distant Realms Online was dead.</p>

<p><strong>I miss the BBS.</strong></p>

<p>Times were much simpler back then. I remember asking my mom to print out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitfire_(BBS">SpitFire</a>) manual at work, so I could read through and practically memorize the documentation. I remember the hours I spent building the &#8220;perfect article&#8221; to explain buffer overflows in C. I remember dialing into the Library computers (even though I wasn&#8217;t supposed to) and cracking out of the shell just so I could compile and try some new goofy program, ad it was the only way I could find access to a UNIX System V system.</p>

<p>I remember the days fondly of spending hours downloading something, starting it at night, and waking up the next morning to find it, and publish it on my BBS. I remember how nobody in my small town had a clue what I was doing, and how my &#8220;computer class&#8221; teacher used to ask me stuff about what I was doing, out of sheer curiosity. I remember talking with people on my BBS and sending them code to do something, pretending I was an adult who knew what I was doing.</p>

<p>And almost instantly, the internet came along and killed it all. But it was fun while it lasted, and about  year after closing Distant Realms I decided to buy JeremyMorgan.com, and it&#8217;s still here. Still giving out programming advice and trying to help others, still enamored by technology. I miss the BBS, but I&#8217;m glad the Internet has progressed as much as it has. I would have taken me over a year to download Visual Studio Express over a 28.8 modem.</p>
