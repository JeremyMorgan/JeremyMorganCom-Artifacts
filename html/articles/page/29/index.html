  <div class="entry-content"><p>So by now nearly everyone has heard of <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a>, the new &#8220;decision engine&#8221; from Microsoft. It&#8217;s an obvious challenge to Google, and naturally SEOs and Promoters want to know the answer to the obvious first response &#8220;how do I optimize for it&#8221;. I will offer up some suggestions and theory.</p>

<p>Obviously Bing just became public recently, and I haven&#8217;t done any real optimization tests with it, nobody really has. But we know it comes from the MSN engine, and I&#8217;ve had a lot of experience with that. I&#8217;ll explain a few theories I have, based on experience with MSN, and as a searcher on Bing.</p>

<p><strong>What is Bing?</strong></p>

<p>Bing is the new search engine developed by Microsoft, as a replacement for Live.com. In my opinion Bing won&#8217;t be a &#8220;Google killer&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s designed to be. I think Microsoft sees it an improvement over Live, and a slight difference in approach. In their own words:</p>

<blockquote><p>We took a new approach to go beyond search to build what we call a decision engine. With a powerful set of intuitive tools on top of a world class search service, Bing will help you make smarter, faster decisions. We included features that deliver the best results, presented in a more organized way to simplify key tasks and help you make important decisions faster.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree that is pretty vague. But to sum it up, it&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s replacement for Live, with a retooled engine, different interface, and a few extra cool tools. So far as a searcher, I really like it.</p>

<p>So how do I optimize?</p>

<p>So far these are what I&#8217;ve heard are the best factors for success in bing:</p>

<p><strong>1. Domain Age. </strong></p>

<p>Other SEOs tell me domain age is very important with Bing. So recently purchased domains are probably not your best bet. And if you are expecting instant spidering by google, think again. Google has only crawled a percentage of the net, and they&#8217;ve been doing this for 10 years. Bing is just getting started. If you have an older domain you&#8217;re good, if not hit a good domain auction site like <a href="http://www.afternic.com/">Afternic</a> or <a href="https://auctions.godaddy.com/trpHome.aspx">TDNAM</a> and see what you can get. Remember, even if it has a lousy name, you might still be able to get rankings because of the age, and still pick it up cheap.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get Links from Optimized sites</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, this sounds like a no brainer, but hear me out. Any site that has keywords from a certain niche in their title, and links to you using those keywords will help. Think of how google was around 2004-2005. I have been hearing about good results just using this simple method to boost your rank. You can build your own mini network and accomplish this quite easily. And as always, <strong>pick a niche and focus on it. </strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Backlinks are not necessarily the answer </strong></p>

<p>Having said what I did in #2, don&#8217;t be too heavily reliant on backlinks with Bing. Their algorithm was created after the disaster that paid links and link farms created for google. Don&#8217;t count on them putting a lot of weight into backlinks. Looking at side by side comparisons it would seem sites with less backlinks are still beating out larger sites on bing.</p>

<p><strong>4. Fresh content isn&#8217;t your instant in. </strong></p>

<p>Over the years pretty much everyone has Google&#8217;s number when it comes to updating. The more you update, the more google likes it. This does not appear to be the case with Bing. So you can rest easy knowing you wont have to create 10 pages a day to do well. But you do want to focus on those pages to make sure they&#8217;re relevant.</p>

<p><strong>5. On page optimization</strong></p>

<p>This appears to be a very strong factor with bing. If you dont know what on page optimization is, google it (a little joke there) and look into it. Good keyword count and relevance, usability and validation are all pretty important on Bing. Keep your code clean, small and relevant to the topic.</p>

<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t link spam.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe this one appears fairly obvious, but link spamming is not the way to win on Bing. They have algorithms in place already to combat that. Google was a little slow to adapt, and sometimes still gives love to these sites, but Bing won&#8217;t. Focus on another method of optimization.</p>

<p><strong>7. Authority Matters. </strong></p>

<p>Focus on authority because it matters. This is not good news for free sites, blogs and the like. It would appear professional organizations and large corporations or government sites carry a lot of weight with Bing. If you are not considered an &#8220;authority&#8221; in the industry you&#8217;ll have a harder time. So figure out how to do that.</p>

<p>In closing, it&#8217;s way too early to tell any rock solid tips or secrets about Bing, but we have a few guidelines. I have a feeling with time, it will be much like Google, or even better. What I mean by that is, if you make a good honest effort to provide good content and spread it around, you&#8217;ll do well on Bing as well. Optimizing for the &#8220;big three&#8221; isn&#8217;t all that different between sites, and it won&#8217;t be for Bing. Keep it honest, keep it real.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last installment of the Twitter Success Series, I talked about <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/twitter-success-series-part-1-build-your-tribe/">building your tribe</a>. I talked about ways to build your followers by keeping them happy, and getting them to spread the word. In retrospect I realize that I actually did this in reverse! In this installment I&#8217;m going to talk about how to find your &#8220;tribe&#8221;  (if this sounds familiar to you, yes I am lifting that term from <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>).</p>

<p><strong>How to get more followers on twitter. </strong></p>

<p>So now that you know how to keep your tribe happy, let&#8217;s talk about ways to find your tribe! There are many ways to find followers on twitter. First off, you have to understand how twitter works. Followers are people who are following your updates. You can&#8217;t force people to follow you, only entice them to. How do you do that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get their attention by following them.</p></li>
<li><p>Get &#8220;Re Tweets&#8221; from others, and having people find you.</p></li>
<li><p>Tweeting to other users and having them reply back (people watch conversations)</p></li>
<li><p>Linking to your twitter site outside of twitter, on your blog or website.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow Friday mentions.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So these are the best ways to get people to follow you. If you post something awesome, and someone with 10,000 followers &#8220;re tweets&#8221; it (<a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/twitter/twitter-101-for-beginners/">what is a re tweet?</a>), they will all see a link to your profile. If they like what they see, they&#8217;ll follow you. I have gathered a lot of followers this way. Conversations with others will show your @username on someone else&#8217;s profile, and that is also another way to get attention. Follow friday mentions help too. (What is follow friday?)&#8221;.</p>

<p>The fastest and most effective way is to follow others. If you follow people with similar interests, you can learn a lot. Also, if they check out your tweets and think you&#8217;ll add value, they will follow you too. Here are some great tools for doing just that.</p>

<p><strong>Tools for adding Followers on Twitter. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Twollo [<a href="http://www.twollo.com">website</a>]

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>The free version works pretty well. Adds users automatically, 24 hours a day. You can target the types of users you want to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> All adds come from same IP, so it has to abide by some limits. You&#8217;re in a queue with everyone else, so adds can be kind of slow.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a great service to get started out with. If you have a lot of accounts, and want to grow a network very fast, you will definitely want to pony up for the premium access.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many ways of getting followers, and we&#8217;ve covered a few. There is one thing I can&#8217;t stress enough: <strong>Only gather followers with relevant interests!</strong> Targeting is extremely important. It&#8217;s far better to have 10 relevant followers who read your stuff than 10,000 followers who don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re just trying to get big numbers, you&#8217;ll be very disappointed.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t fall for the pyramid adding schemes that add thousands fo spammers as followers, fill up your timeline with crap and take your money. I won&#8217;t mention names, but you&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Only follow people you care to read, and only try to get people following you who are interested in what you have to say.</p>

<p>In the next edition of the Twitter Success Series, we&#8217;ll talk about tools that make your life easier. There are countless twitter tools out there, and we&#8217;ll go through the best ones.</p>

<p>Till next time, good luck in your pursuits!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you&#8217;ve finally signed up for your twitter account, and you are probably wondering: what now? How does this work?</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d write a quick guide to Twitter for the absolute beginner, to lay down some of the basics of this fast paced social platform. This isn&#8217;t necessarily targeted to marketers, as much as just beginner twitter users.</p>

<h3>So what&#8217;s the point?</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s probably your first question. Twitter is all about &#8220;microblogging&#8221;. Which basically means stuff you want to share with the world, but not necessarily enough content to fill a whole blog post. For instance, you might be having some really good Indian food for lunch, and you want to tell your friends about it. You could fill a whole blog post with it, but you just want to give out some basic details rather than punishing your readers with 5 paragraphs. That&#8217;s what twitter is for.</p>

<h3>Typical tweets:</h3>

<hr />

<p>Pink Martini and the Symphony are awesome! I have a new appreciation for this band! #pinkmartini
_about 11 hours ago from web _</p>

<hr />

<p>RT@pdxdev The ultimate jquery list - 100 plugins and examples &#8211;> http://tinyurl.com/lrvjes #jquery
_about 24 hours ago from web _</p>

<hr />

<p>Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.
_3:30 PM May 29th from TweetDeck _</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, if you read through those, you can see that none of them are really worthy of some huge blog post. I could ramble on and do a full article, or I could just tell you I enjoyed the Pink Martini show, and you could do a little research and learn more about it, if you care.</p>

<p>I also use it to post links to stuff I think people will find interesting, or I put in a funny quip or a quote. My advice: Don&#8217;t think too hard about your tweets. Just post stuff. Eventually you&#8217;ll get the hang of it, and your personality will start to show through. Anyway&#8230; here is a quick FAQ on twitter, as promised.</p>

<h3>What is a &#8220;follower&#8221; and how do I follow someone?</h3>

<p>I get this question a lot. This is different from being &#8220;friends&#8221; on Facebook or Myspace. When you follow someone, all you are doing is subscribing to their tweets. What that means is, when you log into to twitter their tweets will show up. By following them, you are watching what they post, and you can see what&#8217;s going on in their life.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t necessarily follow you back, unlike social sites of the past where there was a mutual connection automatically. Most people should follow you back, but many won&#8217;t. In fact if they are a celebrity it&#8217;s very likely they won&#8217;t follow you back. But you might be really curious what Ashton Kutcher had for lunch, so follow him!</p>

<h3>What does @JeremyCMorgan mean??</h3>

<p>Anytime you put @ before a username, you will come up on their page. This is not a direct message, but more like a message you want directed at the person, or you want to mention them. Think of it in a literal sense, &#8220;Jeremy says At aplusk hey straighten out your hat bozo&#8221;. What this means is, others can see that I am giving Ashton a message, and if he checks his replies he&#8217;ll see it (and instantly ignore it I&#8217;m sure). And I say it loud so everyone can hear it. If I want to send a direct message that only he could see, I would type D and then the user name, like this:</p>

<p>d aplusk You better be nice to those kids, or Bruce will kill you. Have you seen Die Hard?</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of a private message in a chat room.</p>

<p><strong>What is RT or ReTweeting?</strong></p>

<p>****Re Tweeting is basically the same as forwarding an email. If someone tweets something you want to share with your followers, simply put RT @username or some variation of that (RT@ RT: @, etc) and you give that person credit for it.</p>

<p>If you repost things others have posted without giving them credit, they might get upset. It&#8217;s not a rule as much as it is a simple judgment call on your part.</p>

<h3>What is a Hashtag? (#programming, etc)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard this question several times as well. &#8220;Whats the difference between that and using it as a keyword?&#8221;. The simple answer is, if you put a # before a keyword it will place it into a group. And people can view those groups on <a href="http://hashtags.org/">hashtag.org</a> or through twitter searches. For instance, if I post something like this:</p>

<p>Wow, I just found out keyword stuffing is a horrible idea for #seo!!</p>

<p>Then anyone who does a search for #seo will find it, and also the tweet will be put in a group of other tweets marked with #seo, and <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/seo/messages">viewable here. </a> Pretty neat huh?</p>

<h3>Conclusion: What else should I talk about?</h3>

<p>Well, I hope this answers a few of your &#8220;getting started&#8221; questions. If you can think of anything else you&#8217;d like me to explain or cover in depth, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeremycmorgan">send me a tweet</a>!</p>

<p>Good luck with your ventures!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a couple weeks ago I decided to pick up an apple powerbook. It&#8217;s not my first mac by any means, but the first one in about 10 years. It&#8217;s my first OSX mac, we&#8217;ll put it that way.</p>

<p>Mac users talk all the time about when they switched, and how they never look back, etc, and I already knew I&#8217;d feel that way. So why did I wait so long? That&#8217;s a pretty good question.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons a mac is right for me</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons people use them, but here are a few of the reasons I decided to switch.</p>

<p><strong>1. Unix.</strong> OSX is based on it, and I&#8217;ve been a unix buff for years. Ever since the first time I figured out how to break out of the shell program at the public library in the 80s, I was curious about this operating system. I could write tons of articles on what makes unix great, but that&#8217;s not the scope of the article. Bottom line: Unix is the greatest operating system I&#8217;ve ever used, and OSX puts a really nice interface to it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Reliability.</strong> This ties into the OSX operating system as well, far more stable than windows. but this goes for their hardware too. Apple controls all the hardware, which makes it more expensive, but the integration between the hardware and OS are rock solid. Not to mention you don&#8217;t have to worry about relying on a soldering job some 8 year old in china performed.</p>

<p><strong>3. Power.</strong> Macs have it. Lots of it. It takes way longer for a mac to go obsolete. You can keep them for years and years.</p>

<p><strong>4. Viruses and Malware.</strong> Yeah you don&#8217;t exactly have to worry about that. Yes, you can lock down a windows system, I do that. But the extra time you have to put into that is a pain. And some people argue &#8220;viruses and malware are written for PCs because that&#8217;s what everyone is using, it&#8217;s not because OSX is so much better&#8221;.  Even if that is true, who cares? The bottom line is you don&#8217;t have to worry about it with a mac.</p>

<p><strong>5. Windows sucks.</strong> I can honestly say after years of using XP, I find it somewhat tolerable. You can dial it in and lock it down, and use it pretty reliably. But it&#8217;s still not OSX, and it&#8217;s still a pain in the butt. And the direction Microsoft has been heading with their operating systems has me searching for alternatives anyway.</p>

<p><strong>6. Smug factor.</strong> Admit, it feels kinda good to say &#8220;I use a mac, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about that&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, so a couple weeks ago I picked up a powerbook, and now my PC is collecting dust. I use my computer for the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>Lolcats</li>
<li>.net development</li>
<li>blogging</li>
</ol>


<p>There is only one thing on that list I can&#8217;t do with a mac, though I do it often. So basically if I want to do .net stuff, I&#8217;ll fire up my PC, but for the most part the mac is now the daily driver. I bought it, configured it with Xampp, Zend Studio, Adobe Creative Suite, etc and dialed it in and I&#8217;m ready to go.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I waited this long to switch, but it sure has been really easy to do so.</p>

<p>Get a mac. Too expensive? find a used on on Craigslist.  Even if it&#8217;s a few years old, it&#8217;s probably faster than your current PC. Give it a shot, you won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you wondering what the trick is to making it big on twitter? Have you heard the success stories and wondered how to get in on it? This article describes a general strategy that could help you make the most of this social networking phenomenon. This is the first part of the &#8220;Twitter success Series&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Why Twitter? </strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jeremymorgan/hosted/how-to-get-more-twitter-followers.jpg" title="How to get more followers on Twitter" >
If you are an SEO, Marketer, or Entrepreneur and aren&#8217;t on twitter, you&#8217;ve already way behind. I could post a bunch of boring statistics and news articles, but I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s the next big thing. It&#8217;s exploding popularity is bringing people together in way we&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Twitter is the new Zeitgeist. It&#8217;s the cultural revolution at your fingertips, and it&#8217;s communication at the speed of light. Memes and Ideaviruses spread within minutes instead of days, and through sites like <a href="http://www.twendz.com">Twendz</a>, you can keep your finger on the pulse of the web. It sound&#8217;s corny, but it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>I too was a little hesitant, but I decided to focus some effort on building a base, and it&#8217;s filled my inbox and brought many more people to my site. Let me share what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<p><strong>Get Social. </strong></p>

<p>The whole point of using twitter is communication. You don&#8217;t want to just sit and read everyone else&#8217;s posts, but you also don&#8217;t want to just post things on your wall. You want communication, and you have to ensure that you have open and active communication between you, and your &#8220;followers&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Add Value. </strong></p>

<p>The old buzz phrase from the 90s is back. Unless you are a celebrity or some kind of industry leader, it&#8217;s likely not many people will follow you. So how does a lowly web geek from Oregon like me get followers? Adding value. Here&#8217;s how I do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Know your audience</li>
<li>Post Valuable links to items that will be useful to your followers</li>
<li>Post a combination of current events AND useful how to type links</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t just post links to your own site! Make the majority of links elsewhere</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t focus too hard on one topic. Mix it up</li>
<li>Get Personal, don&#8217;t just post links</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll explain some of these in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Know your audience. </strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jeremymorgan/hosted/how-to-get-more-twitter-followers-2.jpg" title="How to get more followers on Twitter" ></p>

<p>Out of the 1700+ followers I currently have, they can all be broken into a few categories. The majority of them are SEO/Marketing types. That is by far the largest group. Then I have some PHP programmers in there as well, some web designers, a few car guys and poker players. The rest are either people who I know in real life, or spammers who randomly follow people (don&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;ll explain later).</p>

<p>If that sounds like a rough overview of my personal and professional interests, you&#8217;d be right. That&#8217;s because I either follow people who talk about those things, and they follow me back, or they have followed me after I made a post about one of those things. Every time I post about something and throw in a hash tag I get more followers.</p>

<p>While this is a pretty diverse audience, I feel like I know who they are, and what they want. If I started posting a bunch of stuff about politics or basketball, it&#8217;s likely many of them would ignore it. <strong>Focus on learning about your followers and tailor your posts to them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Post Valuable links to items that will be useful to your followers</strong></p>

<p>When posting links to valuable sites, make sure it&#8217;s something useful, that they will enjoy, and Re-tweet or pass on to others. Make sure it&#8217;s stuff that will help them, and they&#8217;ll be waiting on your next tweet. The more likely someone will say &#8220;that is awesome&#8221; the more likely they will re tweet, and spread it. If this is one of YOUR links, you&#8217;re starting something viral. Post content with this in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Post a combination of current events AND useful how to type links</strong></p>

<p>If you notice, I like to post a combination of &#8220;how to&#8221; type links, as well as &#8220;here is what&#8217;s going on links&#8221;. My SEO links in particular follow this pattern. I&#8217;m either posting about how to do something, or something that is going on in the SEO world you should be aware of. You should keep a decent mix of these two types of posts. You can lean in either direction, but don&#8217;t focus on just one type of link.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t just post links to your own site! Make the majority of links elsewhere</strong></p>

<p>This is an important one. No matter how awesome or relevant your site is, don&#8217;t just post links to your site. People will get tired of seeing your logo on every tweeted link you send. Plus, it makes you look like a spammer. Post your own links when you have something good you want to share, but mix it up, throw in a variety of stuff and you&#8217;ll keep your audience satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t focus too hard on one topic. Mix it up</strong></p>

<p>The same theory applies here. No matter how great the posts are, you have to mix it up, keep things interesting. I mostly post about SEO and Marketing, with some programming and design stuff. But yesterday I posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i2HWFaqFs0">a video of a guy doing freestyle stunts with a caterpillar</a>. People loved it!</p>

<p><strong>Get Personal, don&#8217;t just post links</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to fool myself into thinking even one person cares what I had for breakfast. But when I bought a giant burrito at the intel cafe and it took up the whole plate, I had to take a picture. Keeping things personal reminds people they aren&#8217;t following a robot link aggregator or a business. It&#8217;s a person behind the tweets, and that&#8217;s important.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, the first step to building your &#8220;tribe&#8221; of followers is to post great stuff. Be unique. Be remarkable, be different. <strong>Give your twitter followers a reason to follow you, and make them antipate your next tweet. </strong></p>

<p>Just doing this alone will help you build a following. But in the next installment of this article I&#8217;m going to talk about how to find your followers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to SEOMoz, this is a list of the top 500 most important pages of the internet. But how do you get on the list? At first glance it looks like backlinks are a big factor, so what strategy should you take? Here is a new idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/top500/pages">Link to SEOMoz&#8217; Top 500 sites page</a></p>

<p><strong>How did they get there? </strong></p>

<p>Aside from the obvious, it appears that backlinks were a big factor in creating this list. Why do I say that? Look at a quick handful of the top sites:</p>

<p>http://wordpress.org/
http://www.statcounter.com/
http://www.phpbb.com/
http://www.joomla.org/
http://www.blogger.com/
http://www.simplemachines.org/</p>

<p>What do all these have in common? They&#8217;re web based products or services that contain their link in the standard install. Even this site links back to Wordpress.</p>

<p>Backlinks aren&#8217;t everything, but I believe they are an extremely important part of the larger plan.</p>

<p><strong>The default link is the key</strong></p>

<p>Even in the early days of the web, companies knew they should put a link in the standard install. This is a link that is already there automatically, like when you install wordpress or joomla. Many webmasters will simply remove the link when installing a custom theme, or during customization. In the early days they did it for the free traffic. But in 2009, there are other factors to consider.</p>

<p>A default link is a must for any web service. A large group of people simply won&#8217;t remove the link. Why? Either because they don&#8217;t know how, or they choose not to. I keep the wordpress link on my site because I don&#8217;t hide the fact that Wordpress is what I&#8217;m using, and I think they should be given some backlink love for providing this software for free. And a lot of people feel that way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22powered+by+wordpress%22&amp;btnG=Search">Powered by WordPress? </a></p>

<p>So now do you see what the big secret is? Create a service or product that will be used on people&#8217;s sites, and give it away for free. I told you this would be an idea, but it&#8217;s not an easy one. But if you build a product, give it out for free, and put your link in as a return you will get free exposure that you can turn into success.</p>

<p>You get:</p>

<p>Free click through traffic
Good branding
Good Backlink stats with google.</p>

<p>Is that worth the hours you put into building something? It can be! Here are some things you could build:</p>

<p>Content Management System
Stats Counter
Chat Widget
Listening to widget
Twitter widget
Link or picture sharing tool
Forums
Rating site</p>

<p>The list is endless! And each time someone installs your product, you&#8217;ll have a link coming back! It&#8217;s something to think about! Grab a good php book, download <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">xampp</a> and get to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday Google announced support for the &#8220;canonical tag&#8221; which is essentially a tag to tell Google and the other two search engines which version of a url you want crawled or indexed. In theory, this should help with duplicate content issues, but is this something you want to try?</p>

<p>From Google:</p>

<blockquote><p>Carpe diem on any duplicate content worries: we now support a format that allows you to publicly specify your preferred version of a URL. If your site has identical or vastly similar content that&#8217;s accessible through multiple URLs, this format provides you with more control over the URL returned in search results. It also helps to make sure that properties such as link popularity are consolidated to your preferred version.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read their <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">full blog post here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why are they doing this? </strong></p>

<p>Well, by now we&#8217;ve probably all heard <a href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131569">Eric Schmidt call the internet a cesspool</a> and we all know about issues with duplicate content. If I understand this correctly, Google is trying to take steps to clean up some of this duplicate content, and asking the public for help.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider doing it</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to jump right into the &#8220;human reviewing&#8221; factor. Forget about the technical side for a minute. Ostensibly by creating this tag, you&#8217;re telling Google what content to grab, and you&#8217;re being somewhat transparent as a webmaster and letting them know you aren&#8217;t trying to game the system with doorway pages and multiple entry points. To the human reviewer, you are saying &#8220;Here is the page I want you to look at, and the other pages are duplicated beyond my control&#8221;. At least that&#8217;s one theory.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, you&#8217;re cleaning up their index of your page, and weeding out any duplicate content, which could make your remaining pages rank much better.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider not doing it</strong></p>

<p>Again, from the human reviewer standpoint: do you really want to let Google know you&#8217;re trying to SEO your site? Google has said time and time again, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769">Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.</a> So in way, this goes against their own code, and do you want the human reviewers to know you&#8217;re doing SEO on your site? If the reviewers start searching for sites who are adopting this tag early, do you want to come up on their radar? That&#8217;s a question you have to ask.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, why do you need this tag anyway? You should be working hard to prevent duplicate content on your own, and not need this tag. Duplicate content is something that&#8217;s under your control, and something you should have a handle on if you&#8217;re concerned. If you&#8217;re using some sort of CMS or other software on your site, is the time or money you&#8217;re going to spend implementing this tag into your pages worth more than the time you&#8217;d spend fixing the problem in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Another good use for this tag</strong></p>

<p>I have another good suggested use for this tag that&#8217;s a little outside the box. If the implementation of this tag goes smoothly, you could use it to your advantage. Right now, if you were to go out and buy 20 domains with established traffic, and funnel them all to your homepage, you&#8217;d get penalized good. But this tag could help you do that.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you are working on methods of acquiring traffic that have nothing to do with Google  (I know, I know but it&#8217;s possible)? This tag could help let them know you aren&#8217;t trying to game them. You could buy different urls for marketing purposes, and point them to the same site without penalty. If you have a domain that doesn&#8217;t quite fit in with your marketing, you could go buy one that does, and point it. Or, if you have a section of your site that could almost be another domain in itself, you could point a domain to it, for your offline marketing and not be penalized.</p>

<p>This is all theory, I don&#8217;t know for sure if you would be penalized for it, but it would be a nice side effect of this tag that I would like to see.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In the end, its your decision whether to implement this tag, and I hope I&#8217;ve given you some things to think about before doing so. Personally, I&#8217;m going to wait it out for a while and see if I can get a little more information before making a decision. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you want to start a blog, and make sure it gets noticed by google? It&#8217;s actually easier than you think, and you can do it absolutely free. I&#8217;ll show you how to install wordpress and tweak it for good SEO, so it gets picked up by google, and you start getting more traffic to your blog!</p>

<p>The first step of course, is to make sure you have the right software on your website. WordPress requires php and mysql to run. Here are the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">exact requirements for running WordPress</a> on your site. This article isn&#8217;t about installing WordPress itself, but optimizing it, so if you need more information on <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/wordpress-help/how-to-install-wordpress/">how to install wordpress, go here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Setup</strong></p>

<p>Initially, you want to configure a few options for best results. The first, and most important step, is your link structure. You want it to be SEO friendly. Go to your permalinks section:</p>

<p><strong>Settings -> Permalinks</strong></p>

<p>The way I have mine setup is by category, then post title. Like this:</p>

<p><em>http://www.jeremymorgan.com/<strong>search-engine-optimization/you-need-google-chrome/</strong></em></p>

<p>The way I do this, is by selecting &#8220;Custom Structure&#8221; in my permalink settings, and entering this:</p>

<p>/%category%/%postname%/</p>

<p>This changes all my links on the site to specify a category folder, then the name of the post. You can also do other things, like put the date in your post, or any custom information you like. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">Here is a list of different tags you can use for permalinks.</a></p>

<p>The most important part of this is to get something that&#8217;s user friendly, and search engine friendly. You want to do this from the very start.</p>

<p><strong>The next step: RPC Pings </strong></p>

<p><strong>Settings -> Writing -> Update Services</strong></p>

<p>In the writing section, if you scroll down the bottom, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;update services&#8221;. These are the different sites that will be contacted when you update. See <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/website-promotion/my-huge-rpc-ping-list/">my huge RPC Ping list</a> and grab that list and paste it into the box. Click Save.</p>

<p>This is an important step to keep other sites updated when you post. This will really come in handy as your site gets larger, and these services start monitoring you. I have seen posts I&#8217;ve made come up on google alerts that same day for this very reason.</p>

<p><strong>Install some Plugins</strong></p>

<p>The first plugin I highly recommend is the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO plugin</a>. This WordPress plugin is crucial for your success.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Automatically optimizes your titles for search engines</li>
<li>Generates META tags automatically</li>
<li>Avoids the typical duplicate content found on Wordpress blogs</li>
<li>For Wordpress 2.7 you don&#8217;t even have to look at the options, it works out-of-the-box. Just install.</li>
<li>You can override any title and set any META description and any META keywords you want.</li>
<li>You can fine-tune everything</li>
<li>Backward-Compatibility with many other plugins, like Auto Meta, Ultimate Tag Warrior and others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>To install it, you&#8217;ll need to download the file, unzip it, and upload it to your /wp-content/plugins folder. Then, in the control panel under plugins, find the All in One SEO plugin and press &#8220;activate&#8221;.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;317&#8221; caption=&#8221;/wp-content/plugins folder&#8221;]<a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/seo-friendly-blog-01.jpg"><img src="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/seo-friendly-blog-01.jpg" alt="/wp-content/plugins folder" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>From here, you&#8217;ll want to configure a few options. Go to <strong>Settings -> All in One SEO pack
</strong></p>

<p>Fill out your title, description and keywords fields and they will populate your posts with the appropriate meta tags. The default settings are fine, but you can adjust everything as you see fit. This makes a difference when fine tuning your search results.</p>

<p><strong>Get the Google XML Sitemaps Plugin. </strong></p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">Google XML Sitemaps plugin here </a>and install it in the same way you did the SEO pack. This plugin is crucial, as you are able to build Google sitemaps and submit them to Google, which notifies them of changes and additions to your site. Don&#8217;t skip this one!</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Google Sitemap setup, <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Start Writing!!</strong></p>

<p>Once this is all said and done, start adding content!!! This package put together will increase your chances of getting spidered in Google, and getting good results. Content is king! Keep adding useful, interesting content and you&#8217;re on your way to search engine success! Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know how to install WordPress on your website? It&#8217;s super easy! First off, here is what you&#8217;ll need:</p>

<p>A webserver running PHP 4.3 or greater
A webserver with mysql 4.0 or greater.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! While I would recommend using Apache under Linux, it&#8217;s not required. I&#8217;m going to show how to install it on a godaddy hosted site, but it&#8217;s pretty similar on any web host.</p>

<p>First Step: Get WordPress</p>

<p>Go here to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress to your computer</a>. Save the file somewhere on your hard drive, I chose my desktop. Open up the zip file:</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;370&#8221; caption=&#8221;The wordpress folder inside the zip file&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg" alt="The wordpress folder inside the zip file" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Select <strong>File -> Extract</strong> Unzip the folder somewhere convenient, I chose &#8220;C:web&#8221; which is where I put my website files.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;381&#8221; caption=&#8221;Unzip files into a folder&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg" alt="Unzip files into a folder" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Next Step: Upload files to your site</p>

<p>You want to upload all the files as they are to your server. Personally, I use <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">FileZilla</a> to transfer FTP files to my server. Here is some more detail on <a href="http://help.banff.org/using_filezilla/index.html">how to use FileZilla to upload files</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use a file manager if your webhost supports it. Godaddy has a file manager utility that works fairly well.</p>

<p><strong>Select Hosting -> My Hosting Account -> Manage Account</strong>
In the hosting center, select &#8220;Your Files&#8221;:
<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-03.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-03.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This file manager will allow you to upload all the wordpress files into a folder. You can either upload everything into the root of the site, or create a special folder for it, such as /blog or /journal. If you install it in the main site, then your whole site will be a wordpress blog. If you create a folder, it will simply be an extension to your existing site. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<p><strong>Create a database </strong></p>

<p>The next step is pretty important. You need to create a database. There are many ways to do this, and I won&#8217;t go into all of them here, but what you&#8217;ll need for wordpress is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Database Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database User Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database Password</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For Godaddy, here are some instructions: <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/36">how to create a mysql database on godaddy</a> or, here are some general instructions: <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/06/06/mysql-for-beginners-how-to-create-a-mysql-database">how to create a mysql database</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have this information handy, open up your website where wordpress is located (either http://www.yoursite.com or http://www.yoursite.com/blog</p>

<p>You may get the Following Message:</p>

<blockquote><p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a wp-config.php file. I need this before we can get started. Need more help? We got it. You can create a wp-config.php file through a web interface, but this doesn&#8217;t work for all server setups. The safest way is to manually create the file.</p></blockquote>

<p>Go ahead and click on &#8220;Create a Configuration File&#8221;. On the next page click &#8220;Lets go&#8221;.</p>

<p>Enter your database information in the fields below:
[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;582&#8221; caption=&#8221;Wordpress Configuration Information&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-04.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-04.jpg" alt="Wordpress Configuration Information" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Then click &#8220;start install&#8221;</p>

<p>Enter the name of your blog &#8220;Ex: Jeremy&#8217;s SEO Blog&#8221; and your email address, and click install.</p>

<p>Make sure you put a checkbox where it says &#8220;Allow my blog to appear in search engines like Google and Technorati.&#8221; (unless you don&#8217;t of course).</p>

<p><strong>You&#8217;re done!!</strong></p>

<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it. Wordpress is famous for it&#8217;s easy install process, and now you know why. You can do it in five minutes or less, and have a fully functioning blog. Be sure to check out other parts of my blog for WordPress plugins, tips and tricks.</p>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know how to install WordPress on your website? It&#8217;s super easy! First off, here is what you&#8217;ll need:</p>

<p>A webserver running PHP 4.3 or greater
A webserver with mysql 4.0 or greater.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! While I would recommend using Apache under Linux, it&#8217;s not required. I&#8217;m going to show how to install it on a godaddy hosted site, but it&#8217;s pretty similar on any web host.</p>

<p>First Step: Get WordPress</p>

<p>Go here to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress to your computer</a>. Save the file somewhere on your hard drive, I chose my desktop. Open up the zip file:</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;370&#8221; caption=&#8221;The wordpress folder inside the zip file&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg" alt="The wordpress folder inside the zip file" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Select <strong>File -> Extract</strong> Unzip the folder somewhere convenient, I chose &#8220;C:web&#8221; which is where I put my website files.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;381&#8221; caption=&#8221;Unzip files into a folder&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg" alt="Unzip files into a folder" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Next Step: Upload files to your site</p>

<p>You want to upload all the files as they are to your server. Personally, I use <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">FileZilla</a> to transfer FTP files to my server. Here is some more detail on <a href="http://help.banff.org/using_filezilla/index.html">how to use FileZilla to upload files</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use a file manager if your webhost supports it. Godaddy has a file manager utility that works fairly well.</p>

<p><strong>Select Hosting -> My Hosting Account -> Manage Account</strong>
In the hosting center, select &#8220;Your Files&#8221;:

<p>This file manager will allow you to upload all the wordpress files into a folder. You can either upload everything into the root of the site, or create a special folder for it, such as /blog or /journal. If you install it in the main site, then your whole site will be a wordpress blog. If you create a folder, it will simply be an extension to your existing site. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Database Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database User Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database Password</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For Godaddy, here are some instructions: <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/36">how to create a mysql database on godaddy</a> or, here are some general instructions: <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/06/06/mysql-for-beginners-how-to-create-a-mysql-database">how to create a mysql database</a>.</p>
