  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wanted to know the secret to getting people to notice you online? How can you get more people reading your blog, following your tweets, or subscribing to your newsletter? How do you position yourself to attract the crowds? The answer might surprise you.</p>

<p>What do all the &#8220;big&#8221; sites have in common? How about the big twitter users? If you really start comparing them, you&#8217;ll find they have a lot less in common than you think. Why is that? Why is there no &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; formula for success? Because if there were, nobody would stand out, and nobody would seem genuine. I&#8217;ll get right to the point.</p>

<blockquote><p>The way to get people to notice you on the internet is no different from real life. You have to be different. You have to be genuine, and most importantly, you have to be&#8230;. you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you feeling a little disappointed at the answer? Let me explain.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the best cross-eyed auto painter I know</strong></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a guy I know who runs an auto painting shop. He has an Albert Einstien haircut, crossed eyes, and his shop sometimes looks like a tornado hit it. He&#8217;s an extremely sloppy man, at least he appears that way. If you were to meet him and look around his shop, he&#8217;d likely be the last person on the planet you&#8217;d ever choose to paint your car.</p>

<p>So, would you be surprised if I told you that people ship their vehicles hundreds, sometimes thousands of miles to have him paint them? And we&#8217;re not talking beat old clunkers, these are immaculate classics to be paraded in car shows all over the country. They don&#8217;t send their cars to him because he&#8217;s the cheapest guy either, in fact far from it. They send them to him because he does such an incredible job that the cars win awards for their paint. The bodywork is flawless, and the paint job is absolutely of the highest quality. Most of the time he&#8217;s backed up for months.</p>

<p><strong>Your imperfections are YOU.</strong></p>

<p>So, do you really think he cares if you think his shop is a mess, or that you won&#8217;t like his crossed eye, or funny haircut? Heck no, if you don&#8217;t like it you can take it somewhere else. The lesson here? He is being himself. He could go and clean up the shop, and make it look like a showroom. He could cut his hair and shave, and show up in a business suit every day. He could move his location to some nice place downtown, and do whatever he could to impress you.  But then he&#8217;d be just like every other shop in town, and his word of mouth advertising would probably drop. After all, what is there to talk about when you&#8217;re just like everyone else?</p>

<p>What he teaches us all is it&#8217;s OK to be yourself. It&#8217;s OK to have flaws and imperfections, as long as you set out to do whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and do it well.  Would you care what this guy looks like, or the condition of his shop when you&#8217;re staring proudly at your sparkling &#8216;57 Chevy at the car show?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be discouraged if your site isn&#8217;t perfect, and doesn&#8217;t have a $10,000 design. Don&#8217;t worry if your writing isn&#8217;t Hemingway, or some of your articles or tweets are duds. Don&#8217;t be afraid to offend people or present something someone else might criticize. Just go out and do it, and give it everything you&#8217;ve got. Have the guts to say &#8220;this is me&#8221; and give 110% into everything you do. Stop caring what other people might think about you.</p>

<p>People will appreciate the sincerity.  Nobody likes to read tweets or blog articles that feel like they&#8217;ve been sterilized and run through a marketing department. They want to read real information from a real human.</p>

<p>Give it a try and tell me about your results!</p>

<time datetime="2009-07-08T13:02:03+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 8<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the design of a product or campaign, most of us strive to create the best product we can create at the time.  This can range from really good quality, to horrible, and it depends on the amount of time, effort and money the creator of the product is willing to spend.</p>

<p>The barriers to building a great product differ greatly. It is significantly easier to build a high quality paperclip than it is to build the fastest computer chip. And I can tell you with great certainty it&#8217;s difficult and costly to build a good 4G WiMAX service too. But <a href="http://www.clear.com">Clear Communications</a> managed to do just that.</p>

<p>Clear built a fantastic product, which is a wireless internet solution surrounding the Portland area (<a href="http://www.clear.com/future_is_clear.php">WiMAX</a>). This product enables nomadic internet browsing all over the countryside, and I love being able to check my email while driving down the freeway. In fact, with the speeds I get from it, I could watch a movie on Netflix while driving down the highway (I bet that thought makes you a little uncomfortable).</p>

<p>The coverage is better than they said it would be. They told me I wouldn&#8217;t get a connection at my house, which is a ways south of Portland. I consistently get a 1-2 meg connection from home. They advertise speeds of up to 6mb, and I get that almost everywhere. So I get more than I was actually promised. It&#8217;s a fantastic product, and well worth what I pay for it. But I won&#8217;t be recommending it to anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Great Product, frustrating service</strong></p>

<p>My frustration with Clear started early. I won&#8217;t go into great detail, but I was promised a discount on it, (I work for the company who developed the technology for it), and never received the discount. After 6 months, I still haven&#8217;t, and probably never will.</p>

<p>There was a referral program, where if I refer customers I get a 25$ gift card. That was the most nightmarish process I have ever been through for a referral, with all kinds of back and forth, 5 phone calls, numerous emails, 3 days, and having to get someone&#8217;s social security number to get credit for the referral.  I&#8217;m really surprised my friend went through all that hassle to sign up. I never got the $25 gift card.</p>

<p>As a part of the package, I was given this neat little USB modem to connect to the service. Worked great until I bought a new PC, and couldn&#8217;t find the driver disk. I called clear, and they told me to go to their website. I go there, and download the Clear connection utility. But no driver for the modem.</p>

<p>I called back again and was told to go to their site. I explained that I still needed a driver, and was told to go to Motorola. I went to their site, and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Product+Lines/MOTOwi4/USBw_100_US-EN">found the modem</a> but their page has no driver download. I called Motorola, and they have never heard of the product.  After sending them the link to their site and doing some wrangling, I find out that 3 separate companies developed the product. None of them have a driver, and I was told: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to contact Clear&#8221;.</p>

<p>A lot of frustration, especially considering I&#8217;m probably working in the same building where the driver was developed in the first place. This driver is nearly impossible to find.</p>

<p>Long story short I pay for a product that sits unused because I was stupid enough to lose the golden CD that guarantees access to the service. I&#8217;m going to go searching through my house and try to find that magical CD, and hopefully get back on the road again. Now, keep in mind I&#8217;m a technical person. Imagine the frustration of the average Joe trying to get this stuff worked out?</p>

<p>Moral of the Story: A great product is something to strive for.  However, a great product isn&#8217;t enough if your user experience sucks. What good is it to have a product that everyone is silently using? If they took as much care into customer service as they did in building the technology, I&#8217;d be a walking advertising machine for them, instead I&#8217;m referring nobody, and even complaining about them on my blog.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve recently started selling some software to add followers on Twitter. A couple  of customers have asked me &#8220;why am I not getting a lot of followers?&#8221;, and some potential buyers have had the same complaint, saying they purchased adders in the past that didn&#8217;t perform well, so they won&#8217;t be purchasing mine. I think I know the answer to this.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/shrugging.jpg" alt="Need friends on twitter?" />The answer goes back to some simple questions. &#8220;Who am I marketing to&#8221; and &#8220;what do they want to see?&#8221;. All twitter follower adders rely on a similar concept. You follow someone, and they may or may not follow you back. Most people look at a profile when someone follows them, and decides whether or not to reciprocate. The factors they use to make this decision are obvious: Why would they want to follow you?</p>

<p>When is the last time you found a profile on twitter of a cute 20 something girl in a skimpy outfit who posted 20 tweets a day that were all links to dating sites and decided you just had to follow her? I&#8217;m guessing it doesn&#8217;t happen much. And that&#8217;s my point, people will only follow you if you&#8217;re interesting.</p>

<p>Am I saying you shouldn&#8217;t try selling your product on twitter? Of course not. But you have to mix it up. A good combination of personal tweets (yes, what you had for lunch or a cool song you&#8217;re listening to) dialog with other twitterers, and links to other cool stuff as well. Posting a lot of links isn&#8217;t a big deal if they are mostly interesting valuable links from different places. Mix your own links in and you can get a good thing going. Post some jokes or funny quotes.</p>

<p>The bottom line: people want to follow you, not your company. They want to know they&#8217;re interacting with an actual human being who has something valuable to provide. If you&#8217;re getting into twitter marketing just to spam, you&#8217;ll be ignored as spam. If you get into it to meet and interact with your customers, and have a little fun in the process, you&#8217;ll find a lot more success.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-07-01T01:02:03+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 1<span>st</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So by now nearly everyone has heard of <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a>, the new &#8220;decision engine&#8221; from Microsoft. It&#8217;s an obvious challenge to Google, and naturally SEOs and Promoters want to know the answer to the obvious first response &#8220;how do I optimize for it&#8221;. I will offer up some suggestions and theory.</p>

<p>Obviously Bing just became public recently, and I haven&#8217;t done any real optimization tests with it, nobody really has. But we know it comes from the MSN engine, and I&#8217;ve had a lot of experience with that. I&#8217;ll explain a few theories I have, based on experience with MSN, and as a searcher on Bing.</p>

<p><strong>What is Bing?</strong></p>

<p>Bing is the new search engine developed by Microsoft, as a replacement for Live.com. In my opinion Bing won&#8217;t be a &#8220;Google killer&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s designed to be. I think Microsoft sees it an improvement over Live, and a slight difference in approach. In their own words:</p>

<blockquote><p>We took a new approach to go beyond search to build what we call a decision engine. With a powerful set of intuitive tools on top of a world class search service, Bing will help you make smarter, faster decisions. We included features that deliver the best results, presented in a more organized way to simplify key tasks and help you make important decisions faster.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree that is pretty vague. But to sum it up, it&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s replacement for Live, with a retooled engine, different interface, and a few extra cool tools. So far as a searcher, I really like it.</p>

<p>So how do I optimize?</p>

<p>So far these are what I&#8217;ve heard are the best factors for success in bing:</p>

<p><strong>1. Domain Age. </strong></p>

<p>Other SEOs tell me domain age is very important with Bing. So recently purchased domains are probably not your best bet. And if you are expecting instant spidering by google, think again. Google has only crawled a percentage of the net, and they&#8217;ve been doing this for 10 years. Bing is just getting started. If you have an older domain you&#8217;re good, if not hit a good domain auction site like <a href="http://www.afternic.com/">Afternic</a> or <a href="https://auctions.godaddy.com/trpHome.aspx">TDNAM</a> and see what you can get. Remember, even if it has a lousy name, you might still be able to get rankings because of the age, and still pick it up cheap.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get Links from Optimized sites</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, this sounds like a no brainer, but hear me out. Any site that has keywords from a certain niche in their title, and links to you using those keywords will help. Think of how google was around 2004-2005. I have been hearing about good results just using this simple method to boost your rank. You can build your own mini network and accomplish this quite easily. And as always, <strong>pick a niche and focus on it. </strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Backlinks are not necessarily the answer </strong></p>

<p>Having said what I did in #2, don&#8217;t be too heavily reliant on backlinks with Bing. Their algorithm was created after the disaster that paid links and link farms created for google. Don&#8217;t count on them putting a lot of weight into backlinks. Looking at side by side comparisons it would seem sites with less backlinks are still beating out larger sites on bing.</p>

<p><strong>4. Fresh content isn&#8217;t your instant in. </strong></p>

<p>Over the years pretty much everyone has Google&#8217;s number when it comes to updating. The more you update, the more google likes it. This does not appear to be the case with Bing. So you can rest easy knowing you wont have to create 10 pages a day to do well. But you do want to focus on those pages to make sure they&#8217;re relevant.</p>

<p><strong>5. On page optimization</strong></p>

<p>This appears to be a very strong factor with bing. If you dont know what on page optimization is, google it (a little joke there) and look into it. Good keyword count and relevance, usability and validation are all pretty important on Bing. Keep your code clean, small and relevant to the topic.</p>

<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t link spam.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe this one appears fairly obvious, but link spamming is not the way to win on Bing. They have algorithms in place already to combat that. Google was a little slow to adapt, and sometimes still gives love to these sites, but Bing won&#8217;t. Focus on another method of optimization.</p>

<p><strong>7. Authority Matters. </strong></p>

<p>Focus on authority because it matters. This is not good news for free sites, blogs and the like. It would appear professional organizations and large corporations or government sites carry a lot of weight with Bing. If you are not considered an &#8220;authority&#8221; in the industry you&#8217;ll have a harder time. So figure out how to do that.</p>

<p>In closing, it&#8217;s way too early to tell any rock solid tips or secrets about Bing, but we have a few guidelines. I have a feeling with time, it will be much like Google, or even better. What I mean by that is, if you make a good honest effort to provide good content and spread it around, you&#8217;ll do well on Bing as well. Optimizing for the &#8220;big three&#8221; isn&#8217;t all that different between sites, and it won&#8217;t be for Bing. Keep it honest, keep it real.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://bingle.pwnij.com/">check out bingle</a> which is a good site to compare Bing results vs Google. I have been hitting this a lot lately to try and make comparisons.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last installment of the Twitter Success Series, I talked about <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/twitter-success-series-part-1-build-your-tribe/">building your tribe</a>. I talked about ways to build your followers by keeping them happy, and getting them to spread the word. In retrospect I realize that I actually did this in reverse! In this installment I&#8217;m going to talk about how to find your &#8220;tribe&#8221;  (if this sounds familiar to you, yes I am lifting that term from <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a>).</p>

<p><strong>How to get more followers on twitter. </strong></p>

<p>So now that you know how to keep your tribe happy, let&#8217;s talk about ways to find your tribe! There are many ways to find followers on twitter. First off, you have to understand how twitter works. Followers are people who are following your updates. You can&#8217;t force people to follow you, only entice them to. How do you do that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get their attention by following them.</p></li>
<li><p>Get &#8220;Re Tweets&#8221; from others, and having people find you.</p></li>
<li><p>Tweeting to other users and having them reply back (people watch conversations)</p></li>
<li><p>Linking to your twitter site outside of twitter, on your blog or website.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow Friday mentions.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So these are the best ways to get people to follow you. If you post something awesome, and someone with 10,000 followers &#8220;re tweets&#8221; it (<a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/twitter/twitter-101-for-beginners/">what is a re tweet?</a>), they will all see a link to your profile. If they like what they see, they&#8217;ll follow you. I have gathered a lot of followers this way. Conversations with others will show your @username on someone else&#8217;s profile, and that is also another way to get attention. Follow friday mentions help too. (What is follow friday?)&#8221;.</p>

<p>The fastest and most effective way is to follow others. If you follow people with similar interests, you can learn a lot. Also, if they check out your tweets and think you&#8217;ll add value, they will follow you too. Here are some great tools for doing just that.</p>

<p><strong>Tools for adding Followers on Twitter. </strong></p>

<p><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/how-to-add-friends-twitter-01.jpg" alt="How to add friends to twitter" /></p>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Twollo [<a href="http://www.twollo.com">website</a>]
<strong>Type: </strong>Web Based
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free (£4.50 a month for premium access)</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>The free version works pretty well. Adds users automatically, 24 hours a day. You can target the types of users you want to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> All adds come from same IP, so it has to abide by some limits. You&#8217;re in a queue with everyone else, so adds can be kind of slow.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a great service to get started out with. If you have a lot of accounts, and want to grow a network very fast, you will definitely want to pony up for the premium access.

<p><strong>Name:</strong> Twadder [<a href="http://www.twadder.com">Website</a>]
<strong>Type: </strong>Desktop Based
<strong>Cost:</strong> Free (19.99 for professional version)</p>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very fast. Can follow 1000 users at a time, and target users of certain interests. You can also follow everyone another users is following, or whoever is following them. Includes powerful tools. Does not come from a single IP</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Can get you in trouble if you add followers too fast (I recommend around 1000 a day). Does not add users automatically, only when you run it. Works in Windows only.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a good utility for people with multiple accounts, who want to add followers very fast. Good for marketers, and those who are serious about building a following.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many ways of getting followers, and we&#8217;ve covered a few. There is one thing I can&#8217;t stress enough: <strong>Only gather followers with relevant interests!</strong> Targeting is extremely important. It&#8217;s far better to have 10 relevant followers who read your stuff than 10,000 followers who don&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re just trying to get big numbers, you&#8217;ll be very disappointed.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t fall for the pyramid adding schemes that add thousands fo spammers as followers, fill up your timeline with crap and take your money. I won&#8217;t mention names, but you&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Only follow people you care to read, and only try to get people following you who are interested in what you have to say.</p>

<p>In the next edition of the Twitter Success Series, we&#8217;ll talk about tools that make your life easier. There are countless twitter tools out there, and we&#8217;ll go through the best ones.</p>

<p>Till next time, good luck in your pursuits!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you&#8217;ve finally signed up for your twitter account, and you are probably wondering: what now? How does this work?</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d write a quick guide to Twitter for the absolute beginner, to lay down some of the basics of this fast paced social platform. This isn&#8217;t necessarily targeted to marketers, as much as just beginner twitter users.</p>

<h3>So what&#8217;s the point?</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s probably your first question. Twitter is all about &#8220;microblogging&#8221;. Which basically means stuff you want to share with the world, but not necessarily enough content to fill a whole blog post. For instance, you might be having some really good Indian food for lunch, and you want to tell your friends about it. You could fill a whole blog post with it, but you just want to give out some basic details rather than punishing your readers with 5 paragraphs. That&#8217;s what twitter is for.</p>

<h3>Typical tweets:</h3>

<hr />

<p>Pink Martini and the Symphony are awesome! I have a new appreciation for this band! #pinkmartini
_about 11 hours ago from web _</p>

<hr />

<p>RT@pdxdev The ultimate jquery list - 100 plugins and examples &#8211;> http://tinyurl.com/lrvjes #jquery
_about 24 hours ago from web _</p>

<hr />

<p>Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.
_3:30 PM May 29th from TweetDeck _</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, if you read through those, you can see that none of them are really worthy of some huge blog post. I could ramble on and do a full article, or I could just tell you I enjoyed the Pink Martini show, and you could do a little research and learn more about it, if you care.</p>

<p>I also use it to post links to stuff I think people will find interesting, or I put in a funny quip or a quote. My advice: Don&#8217;t think too hard about your tweets. Just post stuff. Eventually you&#8217;ll get the hang of it, and your personality will start to show through. Anyway&#8230; here is a quick FAQ on twitter, as promised.</p>

<h3>What is a &#8220;follower&#8221; and how do I follow someone?</h3>

<p>I get this question a lot. This is different from being &#8220;friends&#8221; on Facebook or Myspace. When you follow someone, all you are doing is subscribing to their tweets. What that means is, when you log into to twitter their tweets will show up. By following them, you are watching what they post, and you can see what&#8217;s going on in their life.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t necessarily follow you back, unlike social sites of the past where there was a mutual connection automatically. Most people should follow you back, but many won&#8217;t. In fact if they are a celebrity it&#8217;s very likely they won&#8217;t follow you back. But you might be really curious what Ashton Kutcher had for lunch, so follow him!</p>

<h3>What does @JeremyCMorgan mean??</h3>

<p>Anytime you put @ before a username, you will come up on their page. This is not a direct message, but more like a message you want directed at the person, or you want to mention them. Think of it in a literal sense, &#8220;Jeremy says At aplusk hey straighten out your hat bozo&#8221;. What this means is, others can see that I am giving Ashton a message, and if he checks his replies he&#8217;ll see it (and instantly ignore it I&#8217;m sure). And I say it loud so everyone can hear it. If I want to send a direct message that only he could see, I would type D and then the user name, like this:</p>

<p>d aplusk You better be nice to those kids, or Bruce will kill you. Have you seen Die Hard?</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of a private message in a chat room.</p>

<p><strong>What is RT or ReTweeting?</strong></p>

<p>****Re Tweeting is basically the same as forwarding an email. If someone tweets something you want to share with your followers, simply put RT @username or some variation of that (RT@ RT: @, etc) and you give that person credit for it.</p>

<p>If you repost things others have posted without giving them credit, they might get upset. It&#8217;s not a rule as much as it is a simple judgment call on your part.</p>

<h3>What is a Hashtag? (#programming, etc)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard this question several times as well. &#8220;Whats the difference between that and using it as a keyword?&#8221;. The simple answer is, if you put a # before a keyword it will place it into a group. And people can view those groups on <a href="http://hashtags.org/">hashtag.org</a> or through twitter searches. For instance, if I post something like this:</p>

<p>Wow, I just found out keyword stuffing is a horrible idea for #seo!!</p>

<p>Then anyone who does a search for #seo will find it, and also the tweet will be put in a group of other tweets marked with #seo, and <a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/seo/messages">viewable here. </a> Pretty neat huh?</p>

<h3>Conclusion: What else should I talk about?</h3>

<p>Well, I hope this answers a few of your &#8220;getting started&#8221; questions. If you can think of anything else you&#8217;d like me to explain or cover in depth, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jeremycmorgan">send me a tweet</a>!</p>

<p>Good luck with your ventures!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a couple weeks ago I decided to pick up an apple powerbook. It&#8217;s not my first mac by any means, but the first one in about 10 years. It&#8217;s my first OSX mac, we&#8217;ll put it that way.</p>

<p>Mac users talk all the time about when they switched, and how they never look back, etc, and I already knew I&#8217;d feel that way. So why did I wait so long? That&#8217;s a pretty good question.</p>

<p><strong>Reasons a mac is right for me</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of reasons people use them, but here are a few of the reasons I decided to switch.</p>

<p><strong>1. Unix.</strong> OSX is based on it, and I&#8217;ve been a unix buff for years. Ever since the first time I figured out how to break out of the shell program at the public library in the 80s, I was curious about this operating system. I could write tons of articles on what makes unix great, but that&#8217;s not the scope of the article. Bottom line: Unix is the greatest operating system I&#8217;ve ever used, and OSX puts a really nice interface to it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Reliability.</strong> This ties into the OSX operating system as well, far more stable than windows. but this goes for their hardware too. Apple controls all the hardware, which makes it more expensive, but the integration between the hardware and OS are rock solid. Not to mention you don&#8217;t have to worry about relying on a soldering job some 8 year old in china performed.</p>

<p><strong>3. Power.</strong> Macs have it. Lots of it. It takes way longer for a mac to go obsolete. You can keep them for years and years.</p>

<p><strong>4. Viruses and Malware.</strong> Yeah you don&#8217;t exactly have to worry about that. Yes, you can lock down a windows system, I do that. But the extra time you have to put into that is a pain. And some people argue &#8220;viruses and malware are written for PCs because that&#8217;s what everyone is using, it&#8217;s not because OSX is so much better&#8221;.  Even if that is true, who cares? The bottom line is you don&#8217;t have to worry about it with a mac.</p>

<p><strong>5. Windows sucks.</strong> I can honestly say after years of using XP, I find it somewhat tolerable. You can dial it in and lock it down, and use it pretty reliably. But it&#8217;s still not OSX, and it&#8217;s still a pain in the butt. And the direction Microsoft has been heading with their operating systems has me searching for alternatives anyway.</p>

<p><strong>6. Smug factor.</strong> Admit, it feels kinda good to say &#8220;I use a mac, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about that&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, so a couple weeks ago I picked up a powerbook, and now my PC is collecting dust. I use my computer for the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>Lolcats</li>
<li>.net development</li>
<li>blogging</li>
</ol>


<p>There is only one thing on that list I can&#8217;t do with a mac, though I do it often. So basically if I want to do .net stuff, I&#8217;ll fire up my PC, but for the most part the mac is now the daily driver. I bought it, configured it with Xampp, Zend Studio, Adobe Creative Suite, etc and dialed it in and I&#8217;m ready to go.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I waited this long to switch, but it sure has been really easy to do so.</p>

<p>Get a mac. Too expensive? find a used on on Craigslist.  Even if it&#8217;s a few years old, it&#8217;s probably faster than your current PC. Give it a shot, you won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you wondering what the trick is to making it big on twitter? Have you heard the success stories and wondered how to get in on it? This article describes a general strategy that could help you make the most of this social networking phenomenon. This is the first part of the &#8220;Twitter success Series&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Why Twitter? </strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jeremymorgan/hosted/how-to-get-more-twitter-followers.jpg" title="How to get more followers on Twitter" >
If you are an SEO, Marketer, or Entrepreneur and aren&#8217;t on twitter, you&#8217;ve already way behind. I could post a bunch of boring statistics and news articles, but I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s the next big thing. It&#8217;s exploding popularity is bringing people together in way we&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Twitter is the new Zeitgeist. It&#8217;s the cultural revolution at your fingertips, and it&#8217;s communication at the speed of light. Memes and Ideaviruses spread within minutes instead of days, and through sites like <a href="http://www.twendz.com">Twendz</a>, you can keep your finger on the pulse of the web. It sound&#8217;s corny, but it&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>I too was a little hesitant, but I decided to focus some effort on building a base, and it&#8217;s filled my inbox and brought many more people to my site. Let me share what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>

<p><strong>Get Social. </strong></p>

<p>The whole point of using twitter is communication. You don&#8217;t want to just sit and read everyone else&#8217;s posts, but you also don&#8217;t want to just post things on your wall. You want communication, and you have to ensure that you have open and active communication between you, and your &#8220;followers&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Add Value. </strong></p>

<p>The old buzz phrase from the 90s is back. Unless you are a celebrity or some kind of industry leader, it&#8217;s likely not many people will follow you. So how does a lowly web geek from Oregon like me get followers? Adding value. Here&#8217;s how I do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Know your audience</li>
<li>Post Valuable links to items that will be useful to your followers</li>
<li>Post a combination of current events AND useful how to type links</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t just post links to your own site! Make the majority of links elsewhere</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t focus too hard on one topic. Mix it up</li>
<li>Get Personal, don&#8217;t just post links</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll explain some of these in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Know your audience. </strong></p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jeremymorgan/hosted/how-to-get-more-twitter-followers-2.jpg" title="How to get more followers on Twitter" ></p>

<p>Out of the 1700+ followers I currently have, they can all be broken into a few categories. The majority of them are SEO/Marketing types. That is by far the largest group. Then I have some PHP programmers in there as well, some web designers, a few car guys and poker players. The rest are either people who I know in real life, or spammers who randomly follow people (don&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;ll explain later).</p>

<p>If that sounds like a rough overview of my personal and professional interests, you&#8217;d be right. That&#8217;s because I either follow people who talk about those things, and they follow me back, or they have followed me after I made a post about one of those things. Every time I post about something and throw in a hash tag I get more followers.</p>

<p>While this is a pretty diverse audience, I feel like I know who they are, and what they want. If I started posting a bunch of stuff about politics or basketball, it&#8217;s likely many of them would ignore it. <strong>Focus on learning about your followers and tailor your posts to them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Post Valuable links to items that will be useful to your followers</strong></p>

<p>When posting links to valuable sites, make sure it&#8217;s something useful, that they will enjoy, and Re-tweet or pass on to others. Make sure it&#8217;s stuff that will help them, and they&#8217;ll be waiting on your next tweet. The more likely someone will say &#8220;that is awesome&#8221; the more likely they will re tweet, and spread it. If this is one of YOUR links, you&#8217;re starting something viral. Post content with this in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Post a combination of current events AND useful how to type links</strong></p>

<p>If you notice, I like to post a combination of &#8220;how to&#8221; type links, as well as &#8220;here is what&#8217;s going on links&#8221;. My SEO links in particular follow this pattern. I&#8217;m either posting about how to do something, or something that is going on in the SEO world you should be aware of. You should keep a decent mix of these two types of posts. You can lean in either direction, but don&#8217;t focus on just one type of link.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t just post links to your own site! Make the majority of links elsewhere</strong></p>

<p>This is an important one. No matter how awesome or relevant your site is, don&#8217;t just post links to your site. People will get tired of seeing your logo on every tweeted link you send. Plus, it makes you look like a spammer. Post your own links when you have something good you want to share, but mix it up, throw in a variety of stuff and you&#8217;ll keep your audience satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t focus too hard on one topic. Mix it up</strong></p>

<p>The same theory applies here. No matter how great the posts are, you have to mix it up, keep things interesting. I mostly post about SEO and Marketing, with some programming and design stuff. But yesterday I posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i2HWFaqFs0">a video of a guy doing freestyle stunts with a caterpillar</a>. People loved it!</p>

<p><strong>Get Personal, don&#8217;t just post links</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to fool myself into thinking even one person cares what I had for breakfast. But when I bought a giant burrito at the intel cafe and it took up the whole plate, I had to take a picture. Keeping things personal reminds people they aren&#8217;t following a robot link aggregator or a business. It&#8217;s a person behind the tweets, and that&#8217;s important.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, the first step to building your &#8220;tribe&#8221; of followers is to post great stuff. Be unique. Be remarkable, be different. <strong>Give your twitter followers a reason to follow you, and make them antipate your next tweet. </strong></p>

<p>Just doing this alone will help you build a following. But in the next installment of this article I&#8217;m going to talk about how to find your followers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to SEOMoz, this is a list of the top 500 most important pages of the internet. But how do you get on the list? At first glance it looks like backlinks are a big factor, so what strategy should you take? Here is a new idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seomoz.org/top500/pages">Link to SEOMoz&#8217; Top 500 sites page</a></p>

<p><strong>How did they get there? </strong></p>

<p>Aside from the obvious, it appears that backlinks were a big factor in creating this list. Why do I say that? Look at a quick handful of the top sites:</p>

<p>http://wordpress.org/
http://www.statcounter.com/
http://www.phpbb.com/
http://www.joomla.org/
http://www.blogger.com/
http://www.simplemachines.org/</p>

<p>What do all these have in common? They&#8217;re web based products or services that contain their link in the standard install. Even this site links back to Wordpress.</p>

<p>Backlinks aren&#8217;t everything, but I believe they are an extremely important part of the larger plan.</p>

<p><strong>The default link is the key</strong></p>

<p>Even in the early days of the web, companies knew they should put a link in the standard install. This is a link that is already there automatically, like when you install wordpress or joomla. Many webmasters will simply remove the link when installing a custom theme, or during customization. In the early days they did it for the free traffic. But in 2009, there are other factors to consider.</p>

<p>A default link is a must for any web service. A large group of people simply won&#8217;t remove the link. Why? Either because they don&#8217;t know how, or they choose not to. I keep the wordpress link on my site because I don&#8217;t hide the fact that Wordpress is what I&#8217;m using, and I think they should be given some backlink love for providing this software for free. And a lot of people feel that way.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22powered+by+wordpress%22&amp;btnG=Search">Powered by WordPress? </a></p>

<p>So now do you see what the big secret is? Create a service or product that will be used on people&#8217;s sites, and give it away for free. I told you this would be an idea, but it&#8217;s not an easy one. But if you build a product, give it out for free, and put your link in as a return you will get free exposure that you can turn into success.</p>

<p>You get:</p>

<p>Free click through traffic
Good branding
Good Backlink stats with google.</p>

<p>Is that worth the hours you put into building something? It can be! Here are some things you could build:</p>

<p>Content Management System
Stats Counter
Chat Widget
Listening to widget
Twitter widget
Link or picture sharing tool
Forums
Rating site</p>

<p>The list is endless! And each time someone installs your product, you&#8217;ll have a link coming back! It&#8217;s something to think about! Grab a good php book, download <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">xampp</a> and get to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday Google announced support for the &#8220;canonical tag&#8221; which is essentially a tag to tell Google and the other two search engines which version of a url you want crawled or indexed. In theory, this should help with duplicate content issues, but is this something you want to try?</p>

<p>From Google:</p>

<blockquote><p>Carpe diem on any duplicate content worries: we now support a format that allows you to publicly specify your preferred version of a URL. If your site has identical or vastly similar content that&#8217;s accessible through multiple URLs, this format provides you with more control over the URL returned in search results. It also helps to make sure that properties such as link popularity are consolidated to your preferred version.</p></blockquote>

<p>Read their <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">full blog post here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why are they doing this? </strong></p>

<p>Well, by now we&#8217;ve probably all heard <a href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=131569">Eric Schmidt call the internet a cesspool</a> and we all know about issues with duplicate content. If I understand this correctly, Google is trying to take steps to clean up some of this duplicate content, and asking the public for help.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider doing it</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to jump right into the &#8220;human reviewing&#8221; factor. Forget about the technical side for a minute. Ostensibly by creating this tag, you&#8217;re telling Google what content to grab, and you&#8217;re being somewhat transparent as a webmaster and letting them know you aren&#8217;t trying to game the system with doorway pages and multiple entry points. To the human reviewer, you are saying &#8220;Here is the page I want you to look at, and the other pages are duplicated beyond my control&#8221;. At least that&#8217;s one theory.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, you&#8217;re cleaning up their index of your page, and weeding out any duplicate content, which could make your remaining pages rank much better.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider not doing it</strong></p>

<p>Again, from the human reviewer standpoint: do you really want to let Google know you&#8217;re trying to SEO your site? Google has said time and time again, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=35769">Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines.</a> So in way, this goes against their own code, and do you want the human reviewers to know you&#8217;re doing SEO on your site? If the reviewers start searching for sites who are adopting this tag early, do you want to come up on their radar? That&#8217;s a question you have to ask.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, why do you need this tag anyway? You should be working hard to prevent duplicate content on your own, and not need this tag. Duplicate content is something that&#8217;s under your control, and something you should have a handle on if you&#8217;re concerned. If you&#8217;re using some sort of CMS or other software on your site, is the time or money you&#8217;re going to spend implementing this tag into your pages worth more than the time you&#8217;d spend fixing the problem in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Another good use for this tag</strong></p>

<p>I have another good suggested use for this tag that&#8217;s a little outside the box. If the implementation of this tag goes smoothly, you could use it to your advantage. Right now, if you were to go out and buy 20 domains with established traffic, and funnel them all to your homepage, you&#8217;d get penalized good. But this tag could help you do that.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you are working on methods of acquiring traffic that have nothing to do with Google  (I know, I know but it&#8217;s possible)? This tag could help let them know you aren&#8217;t trying to game them. You could buy different urls for marketing purposes, and point them to the same site without penalty. If you have a domain that doesn&#8217;t quite fit in with your marketing, you could go buy one that does, and point it. Or, if you have a section of your site that could almost be another domain in itself, you could point a domain to it, for your offline marketing and not be penalized.</p>

<p>This is all theory, I don&#8217;t know for sure if you would be penalized for it, but it would be a nice side effect of this tag that I would like to see.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In the end, its your decision whether to implement this tag, and I hope I&#8217;ve given you some things to think about before doing so. Personally, I&#8217;m going to wait it out for a while and see if I can get a little more information before making a decision. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
