  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you get 1000 requests a day for your birthday or an invite to (something)ville? Rather than asking all your friends to stop sending them, just block the app. It&#8217;s easier than you think.</p>

<p>What you do is click on the notification and &#8220;show all&#8221;. This shows a full list of all your notifications (messages, app requests, everything).</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook.jpg" alt="How to Remove Annoying Apps from Facebook" /></a>Hover your mouse over the end of each row until you see an &#8220;x&#8221; button. It will say &#8220;remove&#8221; on the hover text, but click the X.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook-2.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook-2.jpg" alt="How to Remove Annoying Apps from Facebook" /></a></p>

<p>Click on Change app settings.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook-3.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-to-remove-annoying-apps-facebook-3.jpg" alt="How to Remove Annoying Apps from Facebook" /></a></p>

<p>Then in this window select &#8220;Never&#8221;.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! You can block all these apps and minimize your notifications to ones you actually care about. It&#8217;s far easier than asking your friends to stop it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<time datetime="2012-04-03T15:43:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 3<span>rd</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you seen those cool little profile pictures that come up in certain Google search results? They&#8217;re usually next to articles, and look great. Want to get them for your pages? I&#8217;ll show you how.</p>

<p>What am I talking about? The little profile picture next to the Google results:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results-large.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results-large.jpg" alt="How to display profile picture next to your Google results" /></a></p>

<p>See how it makes the listing stand out? The click through rate on everything is higher with images. It also looks more professional as well.  This is a part of Google&#8217;s new authorship program which I think will soon make a big impact on SEO.</p>

<p>So how do you do it?</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create an about me page on your site (if you haven&#8217;t already). Here is my <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/about/">about page</a> that I used.   On that page, you&#8217;ll need to link to your Google+ profile page using the rel=&#8221;me&#8221; tag.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="https://profiles.google.com/YOURID" rel="me"&gt;My Google+ Profile&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should go near the end of your page, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter much.</p>

<p>Note: To find your Google ID, go to your name in the upper right hand corner of the plus.google.com and click your name. Then click &#8220;view profile&#8221;. Look at the URL in the top of your browser:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results.jpg" alt="How to find your Google ID " /></a>
Replace YOURID with this number.</p>

<p>****You&#8217;ll also want to put a link back to your bio page in your post, with a rel tag that says &#8220;author&#8221;.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://www.websiteguy.com/about/" rel="author"&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s all you have to do on your site. Make sure the picture you want is displayed on your about me page.</p>

<p>Step 2: Set yourself as contributor</p>

<p>Open your Google+ page.
Click on &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221;</p>

<p>There will be a box there that says &#8220;contributor to&#8221;:</p>

<p>Add your website to this list (and any other website you&#8217;d like your profile to show up on).</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/add-profile-picture-google-results.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/add-profile-picture-google-results.jpg" alt="How to add your profile picture to Google search results" /></a></p>

<p><strong> Step 3:</strong> Wait.</p>

<p>Now you must wait for Google to spider your site, see these changes and implement them. Start to finish it takes a couple weeks from what I&#8217;m told. You can use the <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets">Rich Snippets Testing tool </a>to see if it&#8217;s working yet, and see what data Google sees about your site.</p>

<p>This is a good way to bring some professionalism and credibility to your site, as well as more click thrus. It&#8217;s rumored that authorship is going to be a huge SEO signal in the near future so that may be another good reason to this.</p>

<p>Good luck, and email or comment if you have any questions!</p>

The credit for this idea goes to <a href="http://www.scottbones.com">Scott Bones</a>, he introduced me to it way back in 2004 and I still use it to this day.  This is one of the greatest organizational techniques I use, and it&#8217;s incredibly simple.</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>

<ul>
<li>Go get yourself a pad of paper and a pen/pencil.</li>
<li>Draw a line down the middle of the page.</li>
<li>Put today&#8217;s date on the left, tomorrow on the right.</li>
<li>Write down all the tasks on your plate today (left).</li>
<li>As you get them done, cross them out.</li>
<li>Tomorrow, copy over the tasks that aren&#8217;t crossed out.</li>
</ul>


<p>I know it seems really simple right? Well it is, and it only costs you about 2 bucks. I started doing this when my boss at the time (Scott) introduced me to it. At first it was hard to get in the habit of it, but he kept on me to maintain this list. As time went on I found myself staying on task better and having less things &#8220;fall through the cracks&#8221;.</p>

<p>To this day I have tried software solutions, apps on my phone, etc. and personally nothing works better than this pad of paper. In previous jobs I have been forced to use software to do the same thing, and found that the amount of overhead that was involved with dealing with this software, spreadsheets, etc was simply not worth it. It takes a few seconds to grab your pad and jot something down.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/time-management-02.jpg" title="The Most Simple and Cheap Task Management Tool You''ll See Today" ></p>

<p>Remember don&#8217;t get too specific with it, just put a short phrase that&#8217;s a reminder, because essentially that&#8217;s what this is. These are not detailed notes about each task, but rather a daily reminder of the stuff you have to do. Try it out for a week or two and see if it helps you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to upload files to your website, making a PHP file uploader is easier than you think. Today I&#8217;m going to show you a quick example how to build one that you can easily use, and modify for your needs.</p>

<p>The first thing I&#8217;ll start is a php page. I&#8217;m using a &#8220;index switched&#8221; page format here, meaning everything will be done with one file. This is a rather uncommon way of doing it, but once you start getting used to it, it&#8217;s a much more efficient way to build your pages. I&#8217;ll do a full article on that soon, but for today just follow along. Create a file that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    switch($_REQUEST['mode']){
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>      default:
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>      break;
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>?></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By following the code, you can see we&#8217;ve created a switch statement that will control what the page does. For the &#8220;default&#8221; switch, we want it to draw our upload form. This will be what the person sees when they first bring up the page. Here is what our upload form will look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
    Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This form will be what we use to select the file. It&#8217;s just a standard form, but note a couple additions: the enctype (encoding type) and two of the hidden fields. the MAX_FILE_SIZE field is pretty self explanatory. This limits the size of the file that can be uploaded.<strong> Security Note: </strong>This only limits the file size when using this form, and can be easily bypassed. In a public facing site you should not rely solely on this method of limiting file size.</p>

<p>The &#8220;mode&#8221; field is used to tell the PHP script to upload the file, which we will put in our switch statement. Your file should now look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

switch($_REQUEST['mode']){

    case "doupload":

    // upload actions go here

    break;

    default:

    ?&gt;
    &lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
    Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;?php

    break;
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you bring up this page in a browser, you should see your upload form.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/upload-form-php-1.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/upload-form-php-1.jpg" alt="Tutorial: How to upload a file with php" /></a></p>

<p>Now by itself, this form won&#8217;t do anything. We need to add some action in the &#8220;doupload&#8221; section of the switch statement:</p>

<pre><code>    case "doupload":

    // upload actions go here

    break;
</code></pre>

<p>When the form is submitted, only everything outside the switch statement will be performed, and by adding in this case statement, when you set mode=doupload you also run all the statements within that block. This performs the action of two separate pages in one. Rather than call an upload.php you call the same page with a different switch.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;ll add in some statements to upload the file.</p>

<pre><code>    case "doupload":

    // folder we'll upload files in
    $uploadfolder = "uploads/";

    // final path where we want to store the file
    $ourpath = realpath($uploadfolder) . basename( $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']); 

    if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $ourpath) == true) {

        echo "uploaded " . $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'] . " successfully";

    } else{
        echo "could not upload the file";
    }

    break;
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain what we&#8217;re doing above. The steps to this process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Set the $uploadfolder variable to the name of the folder.</p></li>
<li><p> Create a &#8220;final path&#8221; which is the absolute path where we want to put the file. We use the realpath function to get the full name of the path.</p></li>
<li><p> Use the move_uploaded_file function to move the file from a temporary location to the final location and rename it.</p></li>
<li><p> If successful, show the new name of the file. This variable ($_FILES[&#8216;uploadedfile&#8217;][&#8216;name&#8217;]) is the name of the file as it was when it entered the browser.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now you should see a message saying it was uploaded successfully. If you don&#8217;t here are some things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Permissions in the folder may not be correct.</p></li>
<li><p> File may be too large. There is a browser file size limit and a server size limit to adhere to.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So now that we have that done, lets look at the final code:</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>switch($_REQUEST['mode']){

    case "doupload":

        // folder we'll upload files in
        $uploadfolder = "uploads/";

        // final path where we want to store the file
        $ourpath = realpath($uploadfolder) . basename( $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']); 

        if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $ourpath) == true) {

            echo "uploaded " . $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'] . " successfully";

        } else{

            echo "could not upload the file";

        }

    break;

    default:

        ?&gt;
        &lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
        Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;

        &lt;?php

    break;

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve created a script to upload a file in PHP.</strong></p>

<p>But you&#8217;re not done yet. It should be advised that this is a very insecure script as it sits. It is intended for educational purposes only and will work great for personal use or on an internal network with people you trust, but do not put this on the internet as it is! It is very vulnerable to cross site scripting and exploits. Someone can bypass the file size limit or upload executable files.</p>

<p>What you should add to this file before making it public:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Actual file size limitation (in addition to browser based limitation)</p></li>
<li><p> Checking of extensions (don&#8217;t allow anything but what types you&#8217;re looking for)</p></li>
<li><p> In depth check of file type</p></li>
<li><p> checking of permissions once uploaded</p></li>
<li><p> limit amount of files uploaded by IP address</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This will keep your script from becoming a gateway into your site.</p>

<p>I hope this helps new PHP programmers understand how to make an upload script, if you&#8217;re doing something cool with this send me an email!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to upload files to your website, making a PHP file uploader is easier than you think. Today I&#8217;m going to show you a quick example how to build one that you can easily use, and modify for your needs.</p>

<p>The first thing I&#8217;ll start is a php page. I&#8217;m using a &#8220;index switched&#8221; page format here, meaning everything will be done with one file. This is a rather uncommon way of doing it, but once you start getting used to it, it&#8217;s a much more efficient way to build your pages. I&#8217;ll do a full article on that soon, but for today just follow along. Create a file that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;?php
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    switch($_REQUEST['mode']){
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>      default:
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>      break;
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>?></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By following the code, you can see we&#8217;ve created a switch statement that will control what the page does. For the &#8220;default&#8221; switch, we want it to draw our upload form. This will be what the person sees when they first bring up the page. Here is what our upload form will look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
    Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This form will be what we use to select the file. It&#8217;s just a standard form, but note a couple additions: the enctype (encoding type) and two of the hidden fields. the MAX_FILE_SIZE field is pretty self explanatory. This limits the size of the file that can be uploaded.<strong> Security Note: </strong>This only limits the file size when using this form, and can be easily bypassed. In a public facing site you should not rely solely on this method of limiting file size.</p>

<p>The &#8220;mode&#8221; field is used to tell the PHP script to upload the file, which we will put in our switch statement. Your file should now look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

switch($_REQUEST['mode']){

    case "doupload":

    // upload actions go here

    break;

    default:

    ?&gt;
    &lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
    Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;?php

    break;
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you bring up this page in a browser, you should see your upload form.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/upload-form-php-1.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/upload-form-php-1.jpg" alt="Tutorial: How to upload a file with php" /></a></p>

<p>Now by itself, this form won&#8217;t do anything. We need to add some action in the &#8220;doupload&#8221; section of the switch statement:</p>

<pre><code>    case "doupload":

    // upload actions go here

    break;
</code></pre>

<p>When the form is submitted, only everything outside the switch statement will be performed, and by adding in this case statement, when you set mode=doupload you also run all the statements within that block. This performs the action of two separate pages in one. Rather than call an upload.php you call the same page with a different switch.</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;ll add in some statements to upload the file.</p>

<pre><code>    case "doupload":

    // folder we'll upload files in
    $uploadfolder = "uploads/";

    // final path where we want to store the file
    $ourpath = realpath($uploadfolder) . basename( $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']); 

    if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $ourpath) == true) {

        echo "uploaded " . $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'] . " successfully";

    } else{
        echo "could not upload the file";
    }

    break;
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain what we&#8217;re doing above. The steps to this process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Set the $uploadfolder variable to the name of the folder.</p></li>
<li><p> Create a &#8220;final path&#8221; which is the absolute path where we want to put the file. We use the realpath function to get the full name of the path.</p></li>
<li><p> Use the move_uploaded_file function to move the file from a temporary location to the final location and rename it.</p></li>
<li><p> If successful, show the new name of the file. This variable ($_FILES[&#8216;uploadedfile&#8217;][&#8216;name&#8217;]) is the name of the file as it was when it entered the browser.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now you should see a message saying it was uploaded successfully. If you don&#8217;t here are some things to check:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Permissions in the folder may not be correct.</p></li>
<li><p> File may be too large. There is a browser file size limit and a server size limit to adhere to.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So now that we have that done, lets look at the final code:</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>switch($_REQUEST['mode']){

    case "doupload":

        // folder we'll upload files in
        $uploadfolder = "uploads/";

        // final path where we want to store the file
        $ourpath = realpath($uploadfolder) . basename( $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name']); 

        if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'], $ourpath) == true) {

            echo "uploaded " . $_FILES['uploadedfile']['name'] . " successfully";

        } else{

            echo "could not upload the file";

        }

    break;

    default:

        ?&gt;
        &lt;form action="index.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" &gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="8000000" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="hidden" name="mode" value="doupload" /&gt;
        Select file to upload: &lt;input name="uploadedfile" type="file" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Upload your File" /&gt;
        &lt;/form&gt;

        &lt;?php

    break;

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve created a script to upload a file in PHP.</strong></p>

<p>But you&#8217;re not done yet. It should be advised that this is a very insecure script as it sits. It is intended for educational purposes only and will work great for personal use or on an internal network with people you trust, but do not put this on the internet as it is! It is very vulnerable to cross site scripting and exploits. Someone can bypass the file size limit or upload executable files.</p>

<p>What you should add to this file before making it public:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Actual file size limitation (in addition to browser based limitation)</p></li>
<li><p> Checking of extensions (don&#8217;t allow anything but what types you&#8217;re looking for)</p></li>
<li><p> In depth check of file type</p></li>
<li><p> checking of permissions once uploaded</p></li>
<li><p> limit amount of files uploaded by IP address</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This will keep your script from becoming a gateway into your site.</p>

<p>I hope this helps new PHP programmers understand how to make an upload script, if you&#8217;re doing something cool with this send me an email!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re not using Google Webmaster Tools already, you&#8217;re missing out on crucial SEO data for your site. Recently there have been some changes to this tool, I&#8217;ll show you some of the new features that have been added, and also go over some older ones.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t signed up for Google Webmaster Tools yet, <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">visit this link </a>and get your site verified and check out the wealth of information it can provide. Many of the top SEOs dispute the accuracy of some of the tools but they still give you a good idea of how Google views your site.</p>

<h3>New Tool: Site Health</h3>

<p>The &#8220;site health&#8221; function is a report Google generates based on the overall status of your site in Google. It&#8217;s ranked mainly by three factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there malware on the site?</p></li>
<li><p>Have any of your pages been removed via the URL removal tool?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the crawler being blocked from certain areas of your site (via robots.txt)?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If any of these conditions exist, Google will let you know. All of these things are detrimental to your site being indexed and ranked, so you should really pay attention to these things. As a note, my site was once flagged for having malware because an advertiser had malware <em>on their site</em>. Needless to say I removed their ads, but it goes to show you really need to pay close attention to everything happening on your site, because a small innocent mistake can get you penalized.</p>

<p>You can use a website like <a href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/">SiteAdvisor</a> to check your own website for potential problems, as well as keep yourself safe when browsing.</p>

<p>Proper setup of your robots.txt is also crucial. Look at this article for tips on <a href="http://www.seoconsultants.com/robots-text-file/">how to setup your robots.txt  </a></p>

<p>If you want to know what&#8217;s blocked in the URL removal tool, you will get a message in Webmaster tools, or you can look under the messages tab to see reports of blocked urls. This is usually done via a DMCA request or some other complaint submitted by someone else about your content.</p>

<h3>New Tool: +1 Metrics</h3>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools-plus.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools-plus.jpg" alt="Google Webmaster Tools +1 Metrics" /></a></p>

<p>This tool shows you some great information about +1 and how people are using it (or not using it).</p>

<p><strong>Search Impact -</strong> This shows you the CTR for your pages, how much it is with a +1 button, and how much it is without. Since the +1 button isn&#8217;t heavily used on my site I don&#8217;t have a lot of data for it, but maybe in time this will change. This looks like it will be a good way to track your results of putting +1 buttons on your page.</p>

<p><strong>Activity -</strong> This shows how many people are using the +1 button, and which pages they&#8217;re using it on. This information could be very useful if you see certain categories or subjects with more +1 activity, or certain types of pages that receive more clicks. If you have subjects or pages that don&#8217;t receive a lot of +1 activity you can investigate why.</p>

<p><strong>Audience -</strong> This shows you what type of people added a +1 for your page, including location, age and gender. Very useful if you&#8217;re targeting based on these metrics, or seeing what type of people use the +1 button.</p>

<h3>Other Great Google Webmaster Tools:</h3>

<p>The Google Webmaster Tools suite offers other great tools to help you out as well:</p>

<p><strong>Sitemap Management</strong> - This shows you the sitemaps you&#8217;ve submitted and what their status is. This will also show you sitemap errors, which are very important and need to be corrected immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Crawler Access -</strong> This shows you your robots.txt and the parsing results. You can also test what the crawler sees and change the crawler from the web to mobile or image searching.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_703&#8221; align=&#8221;aligncenter&#8221; width=&#8221;541&#8221; caption=&#8221;An example of the crawlers you can select.&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools.jpg" alt="Google Webmaster Tools" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p><strong>Search Queries -</strong> This is a very useful one because it shows a few things about the queries that come into your site. It shows queries used to visit your site, and shows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Keyword</p></li>
<li><p>Impressions</p></li>
<li><p>Clicks</p></li>
<li><p>Change (increase or decrease) in the last month</p></li>
<li><p>Click Through Rate</p></li>
<li><p>Change in CTR</p></li>
<li><p>Relative Position</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If this sounds like useful information, you&#8217;re right. This is one of the best ways to track your progress in the terms you&#8217;re shooting for.</p>

<p><strong>Links to your site -</strong> Pretty self explanatory, but also not a very reliable tool. You&#8217;ll find that there are a lot more sites linking to you than what this shows (check your server logs, or Google Analytics) but it can be used as a benchmark to see if your link building campaigns are working. If it shows improvement on here, it&#8217;s likely you are seeing a big improvement in the actual links.It also shows your &#8220;most linked content&#8221; which can be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords -</strong> Another super important tool. This tool shows how Google views your site in terms of keywords. It ranks them based on relevance, and you can get a good view of what Google thinks your site is really about. Very useful for SEO.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools-seo.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/google-webmaster-tools-seo.jpg" alt="Google Webmaster Tools - SEO Keywords" /></a></p>

<p>If you want to make changes to your keyword density, this is a good tool to monitor those changes. <strong>NOTE: I am not advising you to focus too much on keyword density per page</strong>. This can actually harm your results, but rather focus on keyword distribution amongst your whole site. If you&#8217;re targeting one type of result but talking about something else on your site you&#8217;ll have a hard time. But don&#8217;t over optimize your pages or load up your site with a keyword, these techniques rarely work anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Links</strong> - This is another important tool. Though not nearly as important as external links (links from other websites) internal links are very important. This shows Google what YOU think is important on your site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll explain. If you have a page you think is a centerpiece of what your site is all about, you&#8217;ll link to it on every page. If you think readers of other pages are going to be interested in it you&#8217;ll make sure they can get there, right? If you have a page that&#8217;s only somewhat relative to the overall content of the site you may not want to clutter up other pages with a link to something the readers wont care about. <strong>Internal linking strategy is very important because of this.</strong> If Google thinks you have a page that isn&#8217;t useful enough to link to from other parts of the site, they may not think it&#8217;s very important either. Make sure your navigation is clean, and your important pages are linked well within your site.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostics</strong> - This is an important tool for checking your site for errors (usually outlined in the site health section). Some of the things you can check for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Malware</p></li>
<li><p>Crawl errors</p></li>
<li><p>Crawl stats</p></li>
<li><p>Fetch as Googlebot</p></li>
<li><p>HTML suggestions</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This is important stuff: if Google isn&#8217;t crawling your site properly you&#8217;ll never get the results you want. Make sure and correct any errors as soon as possible. Some examples of common errors:</p>

<p><strong>Malware or linking to malware sites -</strong> Don&#8217;t do it. Ever. Not only because you risk losing rankings but you&#8217;ll lose your audience and put yourself in legal trouble. If one of your advertisers has some questionable software drop them, it simply isn&#8217;t worth the risk.</p>

<p><strong>Not Found or blocked by robots.txt -</strong> You may have 404 errors that aren&#8217;t being handled gracefully or sections of your site blocked by robots.txt that shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p><strong>URLs not followed -</strong> This could indicate a technical problem with your site. You could have redirects that aren&#8217;t working, or &#8220;circular&#8221; redirects that cause an endless loop. You should fix these as soon as possible for the sake of your SEO rankings and for your visitors. Nothing is more frustrating than having to close your browser because it&#8217;s locked in a loop.</p>

<p><strong>URL timed out or unreachable -</strong> This is another problem that causes frustration for your visitors and causes problems with crawling. Use a tool like <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html">Xenu&#8217;s search sleuth</a> to find broken links on your site.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Soft&#8221; 404 pages -</strong> This is what comes up when your page does not return a 404 http response but rather shows a &#8220;file not found&#8221; message. This is what Google has to say about soft 404 pages:</p>

<blockquote><p>Returning a code other than 404 or 410 for a non-existent page (or redirecting users to another page, such as the homepage, instead of returning a 404) can be problematic. Firstly, it tells search engines that there’s a real page at that URL. As a result, that URL may be crawled and its content indexed. Because of the time Googlebot spends on non-existent pages, your unique URLs may not be discovered as quickly or visited as frequently and your site’s crawl coverage may be impacted (also, you probably don’t want your site to rank well for the search query [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=file+not+found">File not found</a>]).</p></blockquote>

<p>They also offer suggestions for <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=181708">how to fix soft 404 errors here</a>. You should use 404 errors as an opportunity to either redirect visitors to the new page, or offer them a link back to your home page or relevant content.</p>

<p><strong>Crawl Stats -</strong> Want to see how much Google is crawling your site? This is useful information to see when and how often Google is crawling your site. If you can detect patterns in this data you may even be able to figure out how to keep the Googlebot crawling your page frequently.</p>

<p><strong>View as GoogleBot</strong> - A great tool to see how the Googlebot views your site, you may be surprised at the result.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope this helps give you an overall guide to the Google Webmaster Tools website. It&#8217;s a great resource for eliminating problems and tracking your SEO progress. Remember in the world of SEO every little detail counts. It&#8217;s those small details that add up to great search engine traffic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are many times in Linux you want to watch your dmesg output, especially when working with hardware to see what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>There is actually a really easy to way to do this, simply open another terminal and type:</p>

<blockquote><p>tail -f /var/log/messages</p></blockquote>

<p>This will show you the last messages posted in realtime. This could go for any log you want actually, and works great.</p>

<p>Also some distrosl have &#8220;tailf&#8221; which does the same thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>tailf /var/log/messages</p></blockquote>

<p>Also you can pipe your kernel output to another terminal. Open /etc/syslog.conf and add the following line:</p>

<blockquote><p>kern.*          /dev/tty10</p></blockquote>

<p>This allows you to switch to that terminal to see the kernel output.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Also some distrosl have &#8220;tailf&#8221; which does the same thing.</p>

<blockquote><p>tailf /var/log/messages</p></blockquote>

<p>Also you can pipe your kernel output to another terminal. Open /etc/syslog.conf and add the following line:</p>

<blockquote><p>kern.*          /dev/tty10</p></blockquote>

<p>This allows you to switch to that terminal to see the kernel output.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ok, I admit this is a pretty obscure one but this came up for a task at work today and I had forgotten exactly how to do this. I Googled around a bit and found a lot of answers I either didn&#8217;t understand completely or just seemed too complicated for what I was trying to accomplish. I had done this with the boost libraries before but I didn&#8217;t have them on this machine so I wanted a clean, stdlib type solution.</p>

<p>I dug around and found this snippet of code on my hard drive, and put something together to make it work. I didn&#8217;t write it, and I don&#8217;t remember where it came from so I can&#8217;t give credit for it, but it works like a charm:</p>

<p>(tested using G++ v. 4.4.4)</p>

<pre><code>string GetStdoutFromCommand(string cmd) {

string data;
FILE * stream;
const int max_buffer = 256;
char buffer[max_buffer];
cmd.append(" 2&gt;&amp;1");

stream = popen(cmd.c_str(), "r");
if (stream) {
while (!feof(stream))
if (fgets(buffer, max_buffer, stream) != NULL) data.append(buffer);
pclose(stream);
}
return data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, this is a function and you simply pass the command as a string to that function. It&#8217;s really easy to use. As a note, you can run system commands from within C using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdlib/system/">system.</a> The problem with this is, the command is often run first, before any output commands and the function returns an integer indicating success or failure, but not the output of the string. The function above fixes that for you.</p>

<p>What it does is creates a buffer, opens up a read-only stream, runs the command and captures the output, stuffs it into the buffer and returns it as a string.</p>

<p>Here is how we put it to use:</p>

<pre><code>int main (){

string ls = GetStdoutFromCommand("ls -la");

cout &lt;&lt; "LS: " &lt;&lt; ls &lt;&lt; endl;

return 0;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind that there is no real checking here, and you should test the outputs of the commands carefully. For instance, when I used it today I had a set of long commands where things were piped into grep and cut, etc and I found that if I got unexpected output it caused a problem which hung the executable. So you want to make sure and validate your input and output as you go along, don&#8217;t just go running a bunch of commands and working on the output without some good error checking.</p>

<p>Here is the full code:</p>

<p>Like I said this a pretty obscure tutorial but I figured if I had this problem, others might as well so I thought I&#8217;d throw it up there. I hope it helps.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
