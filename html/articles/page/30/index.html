  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you want to start a blog, and make sure it gets noticed by google? It&#8217;s actually easier than you think, and you can do it absolutely free. I&#8217;ll show you how to install wordpress and tweak it for good SEO, so it gets picked up by google, and you start getting more traffic to your blog!</p>

<p>The first step of course, is to make sure you have the right software on your website. WordPress requires php and mysql to run. Here are the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">exact requirements for running WordPress</a> on your site. This article isn&#8217;t about installing WordPress itself, but optimizing it, so if you need more information on <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/wordpress-help/how-to-install-wordpress/">how to install wordpress, go here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Setup</strong></p>

<p>Initially, you want to configure a few options for best results. The first, and most important step, is your link structure. You want it to be SEO friendly. Go to your permalinks section:</p>

<p><strong>Settings -> Permalinks</strong></p>

<p>The way I have mine setup is by category, then post title. Like this:</p>

<p><em>http://www.jeremymorgan.com/<strong>search-engine-optimization/you-need-google-chrome/</strong></em></p>

<p>The way I do this, is by selecting &#8220;Custom Structure&#8221; in my permalink settings, and entering this:</p>

<p>/%category%/%postname%/</p>

<p>This changes all my links on the site to specify a category folder, then the name of the post. You can also do other things, like put the date in your post, or any custom information you like. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">Here is a list of different tags you can use for permalinks.</a></p>

<p>The most important part of this is to get something that&#8217;s user friendly, and search engine friendly. You want to do this from the very start.</p>

<p><strong>The next step: RPC Pings </strong></p>

<p><strong>Settings -> Writing -> Update Services</strong></p>

<p>In the writing section, if you scroll down the bottom, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;update services&#8221;. These are the different sites that will be contacted when you update. See <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/website-promotion/my-huge-rpc-ping-list/">my huge RPC Ping list</a> and grab that list and paste it into the box. Click Save.</p>

<p>This is an important step to keep other sites updated when you post. This will really come in handy as your site gets larger, and these services start monitoring you. I have seen posts I&#8217;ve made come up on google alerts that same day for this very reason.</p>

<p><strong>Install some Plugins</strong></p>

<p>The first plugin I highly recommend is the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO plugin</a>. This WordPress plugin is crucial for your success.</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Automatically optimizes your titles for search engines</li>
<li>Generates META tags automatically</li>
<li>Avoids the typical duplicate content found on Wordpress blogs</li>
<li>For Wordpress 2.7 you don&#8217;t even have to look at the options, it works out-of-the-box. Just install.</li>
<li>You can override any title and set any META description and any META keywords you want.</li>
<li>You can fine-tune everything</li>
<li>Backward-Compatibility with many other plugins, like Auto Meta, Ultimate Tag Warrior and others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>To install it, you&#8217;ll need to download the file, unzip it, and upload it to your /wp-content/plugins folder. Then, in the control panel under plugins, find the All in One SEO plugin and press &#8220;activate&#8221;.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;317&#8221; caption=&#8221;/wp-content/plugins folder&#8221;]<a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/seo-friendly-blog-01.jpg"><img src="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/hosted/seo-friendly-blog-01.jpg" alt="/wp-content/plugins folder" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>From here, you&#8217;ll want to configure a few options. Go to <strong>Settings -> All in One SEO pack
</strong></p>

<p>Fill out your title, description and keywords fields and they will populate your posts with the appropriate meta tags. The default settings are fine, but you can adjust everything as you see fit. This makes a difference when fine tuning your search results.</p>

<p><strong>Get the Google XML Sitemaps Plugin. </strong></p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">Google XML Sitemaps plugin here </a>and install it in the same way you did the SEO pack. This plugin is crucial, as you are able to build Google sitemaps and submit them to Google, which notifies them of changes and additions to your site. Don&#8217;t skip this one!</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have a Google Sitemap setup, <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Start Writing!!</strong></p>

<p>Once this is all said and done, start adding content!!! This package put together will increase your chances of getting spidered in Google, and getting good results. Content is king! Keep adding useful, interesting content and you&#8217;re on your way to search engine success! Good luck!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Want to know how to install WordPress on your website? It&#8217;s super easy! First off, here is what you&#8217;ll need:</p>

<p>A webserver running PHP 4.3 or greater
A webserver with mysql 4.0 or greater.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! While I would recommend using Apache under Linux, it&#8217;s not required. I&#8217;m going to show how to install it on a godaddy hosted site, but it&#8217;s pretty similar on any web host.</p>

<p>First Step: Get WordPress</p>

<p>Go here to <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress to your computer</a>. Save the file somewhere on your hard drive, I chose my desktop. Open up the zip file:</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;370&#8221; caption=&#8221;The wordpress folder inside the zip file&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-01.jpg" alt="The wordpress folder inside the zip file" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Select <strong>File -> Extract</strong> Unzip the folder somewhere convenient, I chose &#8220;C:web&#8221; which is where I put my website files.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;381&#8221; caption=&#8221;Unzip files into a folder&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-02.jpg" alt="Unzip files into a folder" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Next Step: Upload files to your site</p>

<p>You want to upload all the files as they are to your server. Personally, I use <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/download.php">FileZilla</a> to transfer FTP files to my server. Here is some more detail on <a href="http://help.banff.org/using_filezilla/index.html">how to use FileZilla to upload files</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use a file manager if your webhost supports it. Godaddy has a file manager utility that works fairly well.</p>

<p><strong>Select Hosting -> My Hosting Account -> Manage Account</strong>
In the hosting center, select &#8220;Your Files&#8221;:
<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-03.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-03.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This file manager will allow you to upload all the wordpress files into a folder. You can either upload everything into the root of the site, or create a special folder for it, such as /blog or /journal. If you install it in the main site, then your whole site will be a wordpress blog. If you create a folder, it will simply be an extension to your existing site. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<p><strong>Create a database </strong></p>

<p>The next step is pretty important. You need to create a database. There are many ways to do this, and I won&#8217;t go into all of them here, but what you&#8217;ll need for wordpress is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Database Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database User Name</p></li>
<li><p>Database Password</p></li>
</ul>


<p>For Godaddy, here are some instructions: <a href="http://help.godaddy.com/article/36">how to create a mysql database on godaddy</a> or, here are some general instructions: <a href="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/06/06/mysql-for-beginners-how-to-create-a-mysql-database">how to create a mysql database</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have this information handy, open up your website where wordpress is located (either http://www.yoursite.com or http://www.yoursite.com/blog</p>

<p>You may get the Following Message:</p>

<blockquote><p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a wp-config.php file. I need this before we can get started. Need more help? We got it. You can create a wp-config.php file through a web interface, but this doesn&#8217;t work for all server setups. The safest way is to manually create the file.</p></blockquote>

<p>Go ahead and click on &#8220;Create a Configuration File&#8221;. On the next page click &#8220;Lets go&#8221;.</p>

<p>Enter your database information in the fields below:
[caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;582&#8221; caption=&#8221;Wordpress Configuration Information&#8221;]<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-04.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/how-to-install-wordpress-04.jpg" alt="Wordpress Configuration Information" /></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Then click &#8220;start install&#8221;</p>

<p>Enter the name of your blog &#8220;Ex: Jeremy&#8217;s SEO Blog&#8221; and your email address, and click install.</p>

<p>Make sure you put a checkbox where it says &#8220;Allow my blog to appear in search engines like Google and Technorati.&#8221; (unless you don&#8217;t of course).</p>

<p><strong>You&#8217;re done!!</strong></p>

<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it. Wordpress is famous for it&#8217;s easy install process, and now you know why. You can do it in five minutes or less, and have a fully functioning blog. Be sure to check out other parts of my blog for WordPress plugins, tips and tricks.</p>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-02-05T23:51:48+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 5<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, are you thinking about hiring an SEO? As more and more small businesses look for opportunities to grow, the term SEO (Search Engine Optimization) always seems to come up. Someone has a story about some business who made millions off tweaking a meta tag, and people get very excited. But before you go running out and hiring someone, there are a few things you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t fall for the get rich quick story. </strong></p>

<p>For one thing, let me be the first to tell you that a lot of stories about SEO are either exaggerated, or simply untrue. Yes, you can make a lot of money from SEO, there is no doubt about that. But in talks with people at parties, or other social gatherings I hear more and more &#8220;SEO stories&#8221; that sell a too good to be true situation and you should be aware of it. If they are unaware of my SEO background, they even tell me this stuff.</p>

<p>They talk about some kid who tweaked a few tags and made millions of dollars off his blog, or a company who boosted their profits 300% in a month from a little SEO. I&#8217;m not sure where these stories originate, but you must keep in mind that SEO is new, but the same old rules apply. <strong>There is no get rich quick method</strong>, and you won&#8217;t get something for nothing. SEO will certainly be a positive addition to your business, but it requires hard work and sacrifice just like anything else. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Manage your own expectations </strong></p>

<p>SEO is good, it&#8217;s obviously what I base this website on. It&#8217;s what I do for a living, and I don&#8217;t want to try and downplay it&#8217;s importance. However, it is by no means a silver bullet that will make any business successful. It&#8217;s not the &#8220;secret trick&#8221; to make you rich. It&#8217;s something you do to grow your business and it works, but don&#8217;t expect millions to pour in every night.</p>

<p><strong>SEO takes time.</strong></p>

<p>SEO is a long, continuous process that requires work and maintenance. Gone are the days where you could hire someone to tweak some code, and sit back to collect the riches. It takes a long time to get going, and requires maintenance. <strong>It could be months, or longer before you see any improvement</strong> in traffic and sales. Many times I&#8217;ve seen people talk in forums about hiring an SEO, seeing no immediate results and feeling &#8220;ripped off&#8221;. While it&#8217;s certainly true in some cases, in other cases the person or company actually did positive things for your site, and it took a while to kick in. It can take days, months or even years for the effects to be seen, so be patient. Content has to be spidered, links have to be built and indexed, and the major search engines do this at their own pace. While there are anomalies here and there, for the most part top rankings come with time.</p>

<p><strong>There may not be a crowd of people waiting to find you. </strong></p>

<p>This has been the hardest point for me to sell to a customer, and something I&#8217;ve personally been involved in before. Let&#8217;s say your business sells <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1B3GGGL_enUS283US283&amp;q=webkinz&amp;btnG=Search">webkinz</a>. If I work hard, and get you ranked up high, you&#8217;ll get thousands of new customers a day, because webkinz are hot. There are 7 million people a day searching for webkinz of some type. This is a hot term, and will get a lot of traffic (and will also have a lot of competition).</p>

<p>But what if your business sells heating elements for clothes dryers? If I manage to get you a top spot, should you expect 7 million people a day? Of course not, in fact around 1,900 people a day search for this, and at best you can expect 10-20% of those people if you have a number one spot for it. Then, you have to convert those 190-300 visitors into sales. It may not yield the results you were expecting. That&#8217;s why you need to analyze your business, and your market. Are a lot of people searching for your product?</p>

<p>I may get rotten tomatoes thrown at me, but there are times where you shouldn&#8217;t hire an SEO. If you are a small business that runs on a shoestring, and you have a small market, and an extremely limited niche market, it may not make sense to pay thousands for some top SEO company to get you a ranking. You may be better off grabbing a copy of SEO for dummies (which is actually a decent book for beginners) and seeing what you can learn on your own. Another option is, finding an SEO that&#8217;s &#8220;creative&#8221; enough to find other search terms and streams for your business.</p>

<p>The final word on this is, don&#8217;t expect too much but make the best of what you can get. I have worked with several companies who were fully aware that only 300 people a day were searching for their product, but wanted to dominate the listings anyway for branding purposes. As a business owner this is your choice to make.</p>

<p><strong>Ask up front</strong></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re hiring an SEO, ask up front what they are planning to do, and what it&#8217;s going to cost. Make them go into detail. If they are concerned with trade secrets you may have to sign a non-disclosure agreement. But ask them specifically &#8220;what are you going to be doing to get these ranks&#8221;. And do a little research. If they say they are going to buy 1000 links from various sites, look up some things on google, or SEO forums to see what ramifications this method has. Ask the SEO for this information, and if they aren&#8217;t totally up front and honest with you, don&#8217;t hire them. I tell my customers exactly what I&#8217;m going to do, and why I do it, if they are concerned. Transparency is key, if they are trying to hide it from you it might be something sinister.</p>

<p><strong>Ask about their rankings.</strong></p>

<p>Ask them what rankings their company has. Check on them, and see how well they do for SEO. Because after all, what kind of SEO company wouldn&#8217;t employ their own tactics for themselves? Presently my website sits at the number one spot for &#8220;Portland SEO&#8221; on the big three, and has for quite a while. But am I the busiest SEO in Portland, Oregon? Not by a long shot. There are companies who are doing 10 times the amount of business I am, and they are nowhere to be found in the search engines. They employ traveling salesmen and cold calling to sell their product to hundreds of customers. Think about that for a second. If they are so great at SEO, how come they aren&#8217;t able to squash the rankings of a &#8220;little guy&#8221; like me? Why do they spend so much money on print ads and telemarketing? I&#8217;ll leave that up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Would you hire a painting business who had a building that looks like it was painted by a group of preschoolers? If the answer is no, then don&#8217;t hire an SEO person or company who isn&#8217;t able to get their own site in the rankings (without paying for google ads).</p>

<p><strong>Understand the Process</strong></p>

<p>I can definitely sympathize with the business owner who doesn&#8217;t have time to learn SEO. You&#8217;re a business owner, a lawyer, insurance agent or painter. You&#8217;re not a marketer or computer programmer, and that&#8217;s why you hire an SEO. If you had the time, you&#8217;d do it yourself but that would take away from your own role. I have heard this from customers before, and I understand completely. However, knowledge is power. The more you understand what&#8217;s going on, the more you can control and contribute to your own site&#8217;s success. Browse through some SEO forums or websites in your spare time, or pick up a book on it. You can still hire an SEO but at least you&#8217;ll have a better understanding of what they&#8217;re doing, and maybe even be able to pitch in some valuable ideas. Who knows your own business better than you?</p>

<p><strong>Be prepared to contribute</strong></p>

<p>In a perfect world, you would be able to hire and SEO, throw them a small amount of pay and sit back and watch the numbers go up. But it&#8217;s not that easy. Be prepared to contribute and help out. Make sure your SEO knows everything you know about your customers, your business, and your market. The standard marketing rules apply here. Know your product, why it&#8217;s great and how it helps people. Know what makes you stand out from the competion, and know who you&#8217;re selling to. Then turn that information into power for the person doing SEO for you. Bounce ideas off them, answer their questions and help them out. You&#8217;ll get a lot more bang for your buck.</p>

<p><strong>Treat SEO like any other service based investment. </strong></p>

<p>To conclude, treat this like any other business investment. Take care to make sure that you are being treated well, and getting the most for your money. Get as much information as you can, and use common sense rules when searching for an SEO. If you can do this, and you get the right company or person you will go far and grow your business. Good luck to you all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you want to know how to write a text file in C#? It&#8217;s actually super easy. This tutorial explains how.</p>

<p>To start out, I&#8217;m just going to paste the code (I have received feedback about this) and then explain it later.</p>

    <br />
</div>


<p>When you run this code from your IDE (F5 Button) it will write a text file in the C:\examples\filewriter directory.</p>

<p><strong>How to start </strong></p>

<p>Open up Visual Studio Express, and select <strong>File->New Project</strong></p>

<p>Create a new project called &#8220;filewriter&#8221;, using the following options:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/how-to-write-text-file-c-sharp01.jpg" title="How to write a text file in C#" ></p>

<p>Create a new console application and copy and paste the code from above in. I&#8217;ll explain how each step works.</p>

<p>At the top of the file, you have the following two lines:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>using System;
</span><span class='line'>    using System.IO;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What this does is include the System and System.IO classes, so you can use methods from them. Without these lines, the compiler will not be able to fetch the code for the methods we&#8217;ll be using.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>public class FileWriter
</span><span class='line'>    {</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code creates a new object (or class) that will run when compiled. For more details on classes and objects, <a href="http://www.csharphelp.com/archives3/archive497.html">check out this page</a>.</p>

<p>For this application, every task is executed within this class, within the brackets.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>public static void Main()
</span><span class='line'>        {</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These lines create yet another loop, that tell the compiler to run everything within the bracket automatically on load, using the Main() method. Anything loaded in this method will be run when the main executable is run.</p>

<p>Next, we want to create a StreamWriter object. This class creates a textwriter to write characters to a stream. This is commonly used for text file operations. (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamwriter.aspx">more info on StreamWriter</a>)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>StreamWriter OurStream;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, we actually create the file, using the CreateText Method from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.aspx">File</a> class:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>OurStream = File.CreateText("c:\examples\filewriter\test.txt");</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, we write a string of text to the stream:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>OurStream.WriteLine("This is a line of text");</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can really work with this a lot, there are tons of ways to expand on this. You can take text from another file using a streamreader, or text from a database, xml file, or whatever you want. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>When we&#8217;re done writing, we close the file with the following line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>OurStream.Close();</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This closes the stream. This is very important, if you leave too many streams open, it will take up valuable resources. This is especially important in web apps (which this app is not, but something you should keep in mind).</p>

<p>The last line we just do just to let you know that we done.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Console.WriteLine("Created File!");</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When you compile and run your program, you should see this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/how-to-write-text-file-csharp-02.jpg" title="How to write a text file in C#" ></p>

<time datetime="2009-01-31T04:40:34+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 31<span>st</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re reading this tutorial, it&#8217;s likely because you googled how to read and write text files with C++.  And it&#8217;s probably a pretty lucky guess you&#8217;re a beginner, so I&#8217;ll try to explain as much as I can here to make it clear.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of getting into C++, hopefully this example will show you that it&#8217;s not as complicated as commonly thought. C++ can be very difficult, but the performance advantages are worth the effort sometimes. Java and C# are definitely stealing marketshare from C++, but it still has it&#8217;s place in the software development world, mainly in applications that require high performance. But that&#8217;s for another article. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>For this example, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Bloodshed Dev C++,</a> because it&#8217;s simple, fast and free. You could just as easily use Visual C++ express, also free, but I feel that Dev C++ is far simpler, and better for learning the code.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>file->new</strong> and create a new project. Your options should look like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/how-to-write-text-file-c%2B%2B-01.jpg" title="How to write a text file in C++" ></p>

<p>Start a new C++ project, and call it whatever you want. You can save the dev file wherever you feel neccessary. Go into options and choose a folder to put your executable:</p>

<p>Select <strong>Project->Project Options->(Build Options)</strong></p>

<p>This will put your final executable in a folder you can easily get to when you decide to run it.</p>

<p>When you first create your project, you&#8217;ll find the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
</span><span class='line'>    }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This code is pretty self explanatory, and I won&#8217;t go into it here, because we&#8217;re going to erase it anyway. Select all the code in the window and delete it. Replace it with this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>#include &lt;iostream>
</span><span class='line'>#include &lt;fstream>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    using namespace std;
</span><span class='line'>    int main () {
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>      ofstream myfile;
</span><span class='line'>      myfile.open ("test.txt");
</span><span class='line'>      myfile &lt;&lt;  "Hey this is my first written text file.\n";
</span><span class='line'>      myfile.close();
</span><span class='line'>      return 0;
</span><span class='line'>    }
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;------ end code --------></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After you have entered this code, save the file, then press Ctrl+F9. This will compile your executable. Run it from the command prompt, wherever you set it to build to. In my case, it looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/how-to-write-text-file-c%2B%2B-03.jpg" title="How to write a text file in C++" ></p>

<p>When you run the executable it generates test.txt. Everything you specified in your cout gets written to a file. But lets examine how that happened.</p>

<p>The following code is the start of your program:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int main () {</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is the starting point of your program. Wherever you see main() that is the method you use to start your program. By putting this in you are telling the compiler where to begin. &#8220;Int&#8221; is the return type, which I will talk about in future tutorials. &#8220;int&#8221; stands for integer, which is what your main function must return. For this example, you don&#8217;t need to be concerned with that part, but in the future, you will create funtions which return a datatype, and it will become more important.</p>

<p>The following opens up an output file stream:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ofstream myfile;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What this does is open up a stream for file output. <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/ofstream/">You can get more info about ofstream here</a>. By opening up this stream, you are preparing the compiler to output data to a file. You create an object called &#8220;myfile&#8221; that you can use to perform the necessary file output functions.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>myfile.open ("test.txt");</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you&#8217;ve probably guessed, this is how you open your file. You are using that same ofstream object to open a file you specify within the parentheses. In our case, we are instructing the myfile object to open test.txt.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>myfile &lt;&lt; "Hey this is my first written text file.\n";</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This portion of the code does the actual writing. You are essentially &#8220;pushing&#8221; the data to the file object using the &lt;&lt; operator. You can see above the line of text, and then followed by \n. At the end of the string we put \n to indicate a new line. This is what&#8217;s known as a &#8220;escape character&#8221; and is used to create a new line. Play around with this line and see what you can do with it. You can use \n as many times as needed to format your output with the proper line breaks.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to close the file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>myfile.close();
</span><span class='line'>      return 0;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By calling the close method of myfile, we are closing the file we wrote to. While not required, you should always close your files on execution. If you are building an application, whether it&#8217;s just one person using it or hundreds, you should always close the files used, for resource usage purposes. Too many files loaded into memory can be a bad thing. Note that we also return 0,  as a &#8220;success flag&#8221; for the compiler. The program exits at this point.</p>

<p>When you run the executable, it will generate a text file, as you&#8217;ve specified. This concludes our lesson. You can use these same methods to read another file, filter it and build it another file. You can also build something that will filter the strings being parsed, and write strings with different patterns, or pretty much anything you can imagine.</p>

<p>So copy this code, and try it out. If you have any questions, or need general help, be sure to ask in our forums. I will gladly help others trying to learn who are stuck on something. Till then, enjoy!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re reading this tutorial, it&#8217;s likely because you googled how to read and write text files with C++.  And it&#8217;s probably a pretty lucky guess you&#8217;re a beginner, so I&#8217;ll try to explain as much as I can here to make it clear.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of getting into C++, hopefully this example will show you that it&#8217;s not as complicated as commonly thought. C++ can be very difficult, but the performance advantages are worth the effort sometimes. Java and C# are definitely stealing marketshare from C++, but it still has it&#8217;s place in the software development world, mainly in applications that require high performance. But that&#8217;s for another article. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
<a href="//pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/480967/7490"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7490-480967" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="//pluralsight.pxf.io/i/1221983/480967/7490" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

<p>For this example, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html">Bloodshed Dev C++,</a> because it&#8217;s simple, fast and free. You could just as easily use Visual C++ express, also free, but I feel that Dev C++ is far simpler, and better for learning the code.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>file->new</strong> and create a new project. Your options should look like this:</p>

        <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/seo/what-the-heck-is-bounce-rate/">What the Heck Is Bounce Rate?</a></h1>
      
    
    
      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-12-24T17:13:29+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 24<span>th</span>, 2008</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bounce Rate is a web analytics term that defines how many people visit a page, and then leave that page without going anywhere else on your site. If someone lands on one of your pages and subsequently exits, that&#8217;s considered a bounce. If they hit another page on your site, it isn&#8217;t. The lower your Bounce Rate, the better. It could mean more people are exploring your site. Simple enough?
From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote><p>A bounce occurs when a web site visitor leaves a page or a site without visiting any other pages before a specified session-timeout occurs. There is no industry-standard minimum or maximum time by which a visitor must leave in order for a bounce to occur. Rather, this is determined by the session timeout of the analytics tracking software.
I&#8217;ve been asked this question a lot lately because <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> has been featuring Bounce Rate a little more prominently in their statistics. And naturally the question following is &#8220;is mine good or bad?&#8221; or &#8220;how can I improve it?</p>

<h3>What is a good Bounce Rate?</h3>

<p>This is a difficult question to answer without generalization. My answer is usually roughly between 20 and 30 percent is a good target range. There are many factors to consider, a big one is of course they type of page you&#8217;re measuring. If you are measuring the Bounce Rate off an entry page, and your rate is 25%, that means 75% of the people who land on it (through ads, SEO or however) are continuing on through your site. If it is a &#8220;click here to purchase&#8221; page you&#8217;ll be the luckiest salesperson alive if 75% of the people who read the page continue to a purchase page (not impossible, but very unlikely). So it depends on the type of page. For an entry page, or a content page you should focus on the 20%-30% range for best results. I&#8217;ve seen rates as low as 15%, but they aren&#8217;t common.
Keep in mind some sites like news sites will naturally have a higher Bounce Rate, because people tend to scan headlines, or read an article, and head off to the next site. A site like this one (JeremyMorgan.com) is more of a niche oriented type of article, and I tend to run in the 30-35% range, which is decent for an article site. How-to sites may also suffer from high Bounce Rates, as people find what they were looking for, and exit to use the information.</p>

<h3>What causes a high Bounce Rate?</h3>

<p>One big thing of course is irrelevant content. If your content isn&#8217;t what the person searching was looking for, they likely won&#8217;t search your site for it, they simply move on. If you&#8217;re using deceptive tactics to get search results or clicks, you can expect a higher Bounce Rate. Also as I said earlier, &#8220;how to&#8221; type sites generally run a little higher, because of the focus of what people are looking for.
Side note: in my experience submitting your sites to social media outlets like <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://stumbleupon.com">Stumbleupon</a> increase your Bounce Rates. Not because they send bad traffic, but because of the nature of the audience. They tend to be more &#8220;hit and run&#8221; type visitors. They scan your page, and immediately move on to the next link. This is especially true with stumbleupon because their users simply need to hit the stumble button to move on the next site.</p>

<h3>Should I care about Bounce Rate?</h3>

<p>In a general sense, you should pay attention to any kind of analytic data you can get to your site. but for most sites you shouldn&#8217;t invest a large amount of time and money on Bounce Rate until you&#8217;ve locked down bigger issues like conversions or bookmarking rates. In other words, keep it on the list of things to monitor and change, but don&#8217;t stress yourself out about it unless you find an 80% Bounce Rate somewhere. Once you have increased your conversion ratios, bookmarks, and things like that you can start tuning your Bounce Rate. If you run an e commerce site you should pay attention more closely than you would a news site.</p>

<h3>How can I lower my Bounce Rate?</h3>

<p>The best way to lower your Bounce Rate is to make your content good, and relevant. Write good headlines, and provide people the content they were searching for. Don&#8217;t try to gather extra clicks or search results with irrelevant terms. Here are a couple good articles to read:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had this problem tonight, so I thought I&#8217;d share the solution. In many languages you can do a string comparison in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>if ($city == "Portland" || $city == "Seattle") {
// stuff goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this works just fine. But in C#, strings are treated as objects, so you have to do the same comparison as such:</p>

<pre><code>if ((city == "Portland") || (city == "Seattle")) {
// stuff goes here
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, if the city is Portland, it will evaluate as true, making it a boolean. This is a simple step and an easy fix, but I couldn&#8217;t readily find anything on google about it, so I thought I&#8217;d post it here.</p>

<p>If you want to use the || or operator in C#, this is how you do it.</p>
