  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever wondered how the Google algorithm really works? I&#8217;ve gathered some info from trusted sources as to how Google ranks pages. This is information piled together from Google, Matt Cutts and others about how the algorithm works. (Roughly).</p>

<p>The following is my theory on how the Google algorithm works. I used to give this to my SEO clients, on a &#8220;as is&#8221; basis. What that means is, this is simply a theory based on available data and my own observations. It is by no means law, and of course I don&#8217;t have the actual weights involved, but I still think this information is a good guideline.</p>

<p>Lets start with the page. Here are your page-level factors. All of these factor in keywords, but keep in mind that overloading and spamming these elements will be detected by Google.</p>

<h3>Page Level Factors</h3>

<p><strong>Title Tag</strong> - What keywords are in it, most important first, left to right.
<strong>Header Tags</strong> - H1-H6 tags, their content and placement on the page
<strong>Page Content</strong> - All content contained in text of the page (non-code)
<strong>Meta Tags</strong> - Anything included in metatags. <em>Note: As far as I can tell, the only tag really used by Google is the description tag, in lieu of text on your page</em>
<strong>Internal Link Text</strong> - How other pages link to this page
<strong>URL</strong> - Keywords in URL (often spammed, something that may go to the wayside someday).</p>

<p>Google takes in all these factors as a base for your serps. From this data it gathers:</p>

<p><strong>Keywords and phrases</strong> (what are they? what is the density?)
<strong>Keyword proximity</strong> (are the keywords too dense or packed together?)
<strong>Natural Language check</strong> (is it non-nonsensical text generated by software?)
<strong>Uniqueness</strong> (is this text that is used all over the net?)</p>

<h3>What Google Wants:</h3>

<p>Google wants unique, human generated text that is relevant to the content you are providing, that is as natural as possible. Not keyword stuffed super dense text, but actual text people can read and understand. It is also looking for good semantics, as referenced in <a href="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/page-optimization-for-dummies/">page optimization for dummies</a>.</p>

<h3>Domain Factors</h3>

<p>Google also takes into account some things about your domain. Here are some of the factors:
<strong>Domain age</strong>
<strong>History of Registrants</strong> (changed often?)
<strong>Backlinks</strong> to base domain
<strong>&#8220;Neighborhood&#8221;</strong> or who you link to, and who links to you.
<strong>Registration length</strong> (if you register for 5 years, you might be more serious about the domain)
<strong>History of the domain</strong> (what did it contain before? what is there now?)</p>

<h3>Inbound Link Factors</h3>

<p><strong>Quality of inbound links.</strong> (all the factors above, who is linking to you?)
<strong>Age of domains linking to you</strong>
<strong>IPs of those domains </strong>(hint: if they all have the same IP, don&#8217;t count on it helping)
<strong>Neighborhood of those domains.</strong>
<strong>How long they&#8217;ve been linking to you</strong> (if 5000 new sites link to you in a week, may trigger a flag)
<strong>Do they accept paid links?</strong> Have they been <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-report-paid-links/">reported</a>?
Are they link farms?</p>

<h3>User Data</h3>

<p>(mostly applies to those who use Google analytics)
<strong>Bounce Rate</strong> (are people leaving your page instantly? This is not a good sign)
<strong>How long do they stay?</strong> (again, is your page relevant to what they are looking for?)
<strong>searches for your domain </strong>(how many people search for jeremymorgan.com?)
<strong>CTR on SERPS</strong> (this one I&#8217;m not so sure of. But sources say this matters)</p>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>

<p>Here is where I inject my conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat type of stuff. I personally think that Google not only reviews feedback other people send about your site, but they use human reviewers. They have staff who peruse SEO forums looking for someone bragging about tricking Google and getting a great SERP, etc. This is completely unsupported by fact, but my personal belief. I have a hard time believing a company as smart as Google wouldn&#8217;t hire real humans to do this type of quality assurance. I&#8217;m not knocking them for it, as a white hat SEO, I encourage them to weed out spammers. But I have no real evidence that they actually do this.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many factors that Google uses to determine your SERP. In the end, honesty matters. Eventually, Google will end up putting the most relevant sites at the top, for the benefit of their users. So rather than trying to &#8220;trick&#8221; Google, try putting up content worthy of close scrutiny and make it good enough people will link it. Google will do the rest!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now everyone knows the importance of keywords to your SEO strategy. So if you know what you&#8217;re targeting, you can buy hundreds of different kinds of keyword finding programs these days. But are they neccessary? Turns out there are plenty of free ways to get good keywords out there.</p>

<p>The science behind finding good keywords isn&#8217;t the scope of this article, I&#8217;m just going to show you where to find sites that provide keywords for you free. There is a wrong way, and a right way to use keywords, and it all depends on focus. See my article on <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-marketing/targeting-more-traffic-isnt-always-better/">keyword targeting</a>. But here are some tools you can find to get permutations and variations on  your original theme.</p>

<p>Wordtracker&#8217;s <a href="http://freekeywords.wordtracker.com/">Free Keyword Suggestion Tool</a> is one of the best. If you can afford the paid service, word tracker is worth every penny. You can do detailed keyword analysis, comparisons, KEI, and more, and export your lists to a format of your choosing. I use it and highly recommend it.</p>

<p><a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">Google adwords keyword</a> tool is another awesome tool, especially if you use adwords. This will give you a good idea of the popularity of your term, and the cost.</p>

<p>Those of you who have purchased <a href="http://www.seobook.com/3225.html">the SEO Book</a> (you really should) already know about Aaron&#8217;s <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/keyword-tools/seobook/">free keyword tool</a>. It&#8217;s very useful and nice.</p>

<p>I would post more, but this is really all you need. You don&#8217;t need to spend a bunch of money on software to find this stuff. The only paid service I recommend is word tracker, only because of the immense value they give you. Enjoy these tools, and get to work!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Search Engine Optimization isn&#8217;t as hard as you might think.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re competing for top terms, you&#8217;ve got a lot of work ahead of you, but success is still within your reach. Often times top results aren&#8217;t held by giant corporations with thousands in advertising budgets. A lot of times, its a small company or one man show at the top. So how do you get up there?</p>

<p><strong>
1. Content Content Content! </strong></p>

<p>This rule is number one for a reason. It&#8217;s the most important. All the &#8220;optimizing&#8221; in the world isn&#8217;t going to get you to the top, and if it does, you won&#8217;t stay there. What you really need to  focus on is creating reasons for your visitors to come back. Give them free stuff, advice, articles, or tools. There is no limit to what you can come up with a little creativity. Make it interesting, original, and useful. Your site will sell itself soon.</p>

<p><strong>2. Clean up your code. </strong></p>

<p>You can have two separate pages that look exactly the same in the browser, but completely different under the hood. Learn html, and learn how to do it well. Learn everything you can about standards compliance, <a href="http://www.w3.org">w3c rules</a>, table less designs and web semantics. All of these things will enable crawlers to go through your site better, and find your content better. This step alone makes a giant difference.</p>

<p><strong>3. Utilize forums to your advantage.</strong></p>

<p>Forums and message boards are a great way to get the word out about your site. This adds several dimensions so your promotional strategy. First off links in your signature count as backlinks in search engines. Any links you post there will add up, and if it&#8217;s a large forum you can also get some traffic that way. Also, you are getting your name out there, and branding your site. The more friendly and helpful you are to others, the more they will associate that with your site. Many large sites have started from people who were popular on messageboards. Also, this provides excellent networking opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>4. Go high tech. </strong></p>

<p>The only thing stopping you from having really cool stuff on your website is you. You can learn html, php, asp, javascript
and more free online. All it takes is some dedication and a few hours here and there to take tutorials and learn. If you
polish your skills enough, you can learn how to build all the neat features you see on other websites, or create your own.
Get good enough, and you will be able to build anything you think of. There are lots of free tutorials and messageboards
that will help you learn to succeed! You dont have to spend a dime.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get backlinks. </strong></p>

<p>Submit to every free link directory you can think of. Run a blog? There are only thousands of blog directories on the
internet. As I mentioned before, put links in your forum signatures. Submit to every search engine you can ever think of.
Also, setting up link exchanges with other sites works well too. Also, adding as much content as you can pile on will
get people linking in. A few links here and there for every new page or article will add up over time. Eventually, you&#8217;ll
become an authority and enjoy higher rankings, and more traffic!</p>

<p>The bottom line is dedication. You can spend piles of money, or you can take time alone to build it up yourself. No other
business or industry has provided you with so much opportunity. Use it wisely!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the early days of SEO, there was a very popular tactic for increasing web traffic. People were abusing meta tags and title tags, and filling the bottom of their pages with keywords. Such tactics would never get you anywhere today, but back then it really worked. And you could fill up your site with &#8220;britney spears&#8221; keywords and get a load of traffic. So that&#8217;s what people did.</p>

<p>A client of mine heard about this trick on the web. He asked me, to do this to all his pages. His website was selling widgets, but he wanted a chunk of the &#8220;britney spears&#8221; traffic, and &#8220;Pamela Anderson Pictures&#8221; etc. He figured with ten thousand new people a day, some of them were bound to buy some widgets. I explained that this was a futile effort and not only would he be getting a bunch of poorly targeted traffic, raising his bandwidth needlessly, but he made the site look really tacky. This was the reason I refused to do it, above all, if I was going to put my name on a website, I didn&#8217;t want it to look like crap, with 500 britney and porn keywords spammed all over the bottom of it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how that customer&#8217;s project turned out. He found someone to add those keywords to his site. If he did get any traffic, I doubt they bought widgets.  The funny thing is, that was the early 2000s, and now in 2007, I still get the same sort of requests, almost weekly. Why do people want to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Targeting is everything. </strong></p>

<p>If you get ten thousand people looking for Britney Spears photos, and they find your widgets, they are not going to stay. Unless this person has some sort of need or connection to your widget, they will hit the back button and go elsewhere. You&#8217;ll still be stuck with the bandwidth bill. And worse yet, if they are using the Google or Yahoo toolbars, the search engines will get this data back and start to think your site is of poor quality, because people don&#8217;t stay there.</p>

<p>Targeting is extremely important. If you target the wrong market, you can easily end up making expensive changes until you get it right.  It&#8217;s easier to change your strategy <em>before </em>you implement it. So don&#8217;t be afraid to take some time figuring it out. Your ideal market of course is one of good opportunity, that you are able to compete in. You don&#8217;t want to target too small of a segment, but you also don&#8217;t want to get into a market you cannot compete in.</p>

<p><strong>Adwords Targeting </strong></p>

<p>I tell my clients there are generally three routes you can go with adwords. You can put a whole pile of money into the biggest bids, on the best keywords. For some companies, this still only ends up being $20-$30 a day. For some it can reach thousands. And for some companies, this is the best strategy for them.</p>

<p>Another method, is to put in as many keywords, with very low bids, and get gobs of traffic for much cheaper. This might sound like a good deal to you, if you&#8217;re only paying five cents a click, and you are getting thousands of clicks a day for cheap, that&#8217;s probably the best deal right? I usually advise my clients against this.</p>

<p>The third method is to find the most variations on a targeted term, and put in midrange bids on each of them. This prevents you from spending all your budget on a few clicks, and spreads it out evenly, but among relevant phrases. For most businesses, this is the method I recommend.  Even for companies with an ultra tight budget, this can mean only 10-15  clicks a day for some people, but those clicks are interested customers, who are looking for their product.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend it is because they are targeted visitors. When a promoter drops 10,000 keywords into your adwords account, you&#8217;re likely to start drifting away from your core keywords. Unless you&#8217;re walmart and selling thousands of various items online, most likely you&#8217;re putting in keywords that are less relevant to your site. There are hundreds of ways to rephrase &#8220;tire shop in Boulder Colorado&#8221;  but eventually you&#8217;ll end up with phrases like &#8220;colorado tire flat highway&#8221; and who knows what you&#8217;ll get.  It&#8217;s better to keep focused on phrases people looking for your services or product might type in.</p>

<p><strong>Your keywords control your visitors. </strong></p>

<p>If you carefully choose keyword phrases and combinations, you&#8217;ll find that the people who click through are genuinely interested in your product.  Taking a keyword and finding many variations on it is what a good SEM will do for you. They will find a hundred ways to search for your boulder tire shop and try to get reasonable bids on it. And for some &#8220;hot terms&#8221; you may want to bid high. If you&#8217;re the tire shop owner, then &#8220;tire shop in boulder&#8221; is a good term you should spend some money on. They&#8217;re obviously looking for you. Someone searching for &#8220;tire shop in colorado&#8221; may not as lucrative, as the customer could be on the other side of the state, and unlikely to visit your shop.</p>

<p>The better the keywords, the better the customers. Its all about conversion, you can test this with tools like google&#8217;s website optimizer.  There are many ways to <a href="http://www.grokdotcom.com/2007/04/03/64-tips-for-getting-started-with-google-optimizer/">get the best of this program</a> with a little planning.</p>

<p>Here is a long list of <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/articles/101-google-website-optimizer-tips/">google optimizer tips</a> that talks about lot about conversion rate. Less traffic with a better conversion rate can make you as much money as more traffic with a lower conversion rate. Targeting is vital to your conversion rate, and something to really think about when planning your ad campaigns.</p>

<p>In closing, when building your ad campaigns, try to get your conversion rates up as your main goal. Focus on getting as much traffic as you can afford, but when deciding between clicks and conversion rates, choose conversions. They&#8217;re the only thing that matters in the end anyway. Irrelevant traffic seldom pays the bills.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-01-02T22:32:59+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 2<span>nd</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to start off by saying I honestly don&#8217;t know whether text to code ratio affects rankings at all. Almost every piece of SEO advice I give out I have tested and proven, or at least came close to proving. This is one of the things I have not tested at all, but is certainly something interesting to consider.</p>

<p>What is text to code ratio?</p>

<p>Simply put, its the amount of text vs the amount of markup in your source code. Go to view-> source and take a look. As we all know,  this is how spiders see your site. Text to code ratio has zero effect on humans. This is why it&#8217;s so often overlooked.</p>

<p>With the sudden surge of table-less layouts, and the previous surge of CSS popularity, code is reducing all the time. That cluttered nonsense we wrote years ago is 5 times larger, from a text perspective. Let me show you this in action.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table width="600" border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="166" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some more text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="202" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is center text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some more text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="218" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;The left menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Blah blah blah.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look at that mess. It&#8217;s hard to believe we used to write that stuff, isn&#8217;t it? This comes in at a whopping 13.2% text, with the remaining size in code.</p>

<p>Here is that same code with CSS applied:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="rightpanel"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;The right menu

Blah blah blah.
&lt;p class="leftpanel"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;This is some text

This is some more text
&lt;p class="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;This is center text

This is some more text
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from all the other reasons for writing code in this style (extensibility, faster development, etc) it&#8217;s also a heck of a lot less code. This snippet comes in at 28.54%, more than double the amount of relevant text per file.</p>

<p>Jeremymorgan.com comes in at 20.16% (before this article was published). Lets see how that compares with the big boys.</p>

<p>CNN.com: <strong>9.37%</strong></p>

<p>MySpace.com: <strong>4.4%</strong></p>

<p>ESPN.com:  <strong>8.87%</strong>
I think you&#8217;re getting the point here. They are already huge sites, so they care little about SEO, and place an emphasis on formatting, which makes perfect sense. Maybe someday you&#8217;ll do that as well, but in the meantime it&#8217;s not a bad idea to think about code to text ratios and how they affect your site. If you are using a CMS, you have less control over it, but it&#8217;s still possible.</p>

<p><strong>Here is how you reduce your code to text ratio:</strong></p>

<p>Never style individual elements with html. Use CSS</p>

<p>Switch to a table-less layout, and do your layouts with CSS (There are other great reasons for it)</p>

<p>Dont comment your html code, or use worthless tags.</p>

<p>As I stated, I am not sure if it has any difference on your results, but I don&#8217;t see how it could harm them. I may do some testing in the future, though it will be tough to create a good control environment. My official word is: It sounds like a likely theory. It&#8217;s not something that will hold a tremendous amount of weight,  but any edge you can get on your competition is good. Email me and let me know your thoughts or results!</p>

<time datetime="2007-12-23T04:26:36+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 23<span>rd</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wordpress is an excellent tool for blogging. It&#8217;s what I use on this site, for ease of use, and all the nifty plugins. But one problem wordpress has, is duplicate content issues. In this article I will tell you how to resolve these issues so you don&#8217;t get punished by search engines for something you&#8217;re not consciously doing.</p>

<p><strong>What is duplicate content and why is it bad?   </strong></p>

<p>Back in the day, certain unscrupulous webmasters came up with the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorway_pages">doorway pages</a>. The idea behind these pages is creating hundreds or even thousands of pages with the same content on it, and maybe changing a thing or two on each page so the search engines would spider them all and give you more traffic. Google responded accordingly.</p>

<p>So now, if you have duplicated content on your site, you will be punished for it in the rankings. Wordpress has a few problems with duplicating content through archives, trackbacks and comments, so here is our solution.</p>

<p><strong>Step one: Fix your page header.</strong></p>

<p>Go to Presentation -> Theme Editor. From there select &#8220;header.php&#8221;. Put the following code before the closing of the <head> tag:</p>

<p>&lt;?php</p>

<p>if((is_home() &amp;&amp; ($paged &lt; 2 )) || is_single() || is_page() || is_category()){
echo &#8217;<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />&#8217;;
}else {</p>

<p>echo &#8217;<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />&#8217;;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>?></p>

<p>This will will tell the search engines to spider the index page and follow all the links, but it will not follow the links to archives or &#8220;next page&#8221; links which are duplicated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Robots.txt </strong></p>

<p>Put the following in your robots.txt to exclude the appropriate pages:</p>

<p><em>User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-
Disallow: /search
Disallow: /feed
Disallow: /comments/feed
Disallow: /feed/$
Disallow: /<em>/feed/$
Disallow: /</em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /<em>/trackback/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/feed/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/trackback/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/</em>/feed/$
Disallow: /<em>/</em>/<em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/</em>/trackback/$</em></p>

<p>If you need help editing your robots.txt <a href="http://adambrown.info/b/widgets/kb-robots-txt/">use a plugin to do it for you</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Redirect to a canonical URL</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a good tip for any site, not just a wordpress site. You want to make sure www.jeremymorgan.com/page.htm and jeremymorgan.com/page.htm don&#8217;t get spidered and indexed seperately. Edit your .htaccess file, and add the following (remove jeremymorgan.com and replace it with your domain)</p>

<p>_ RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.jeremymorgan.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jeremymorgan.com/$1 [R,L]
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]_</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">permalinks</a> most of this code will already be there. You only have to add the following two lines to the top:</p>

<p>_ RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.jeremymorgan.com$ [NC]
<em>_ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jeremymorgan.com/$1 [R,L]</em></p>

<p>Again, replace jeremymorgan.com with your own site, otherwise you&#8217;ll be sending me all your traffic, and I think your readers might get a little angry.</p>

<p>Using the tips above, you can reduce the chance of being penalized for having duplicate content. Of course you don&#8217;t want to use doorway pages or spammy content, but it will look as if you do, so make these changes as soon as you can. This is not a huge traffic boost type of tip, but more like insurance for the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the SEO world, so much talk revolves around inbound links. It seems the main focus is always on inbounds, how to get them, how to keep them, and how to attract links from &#8220;authority&#8221; sites.</p>

<p>While inbound linking is crucial to SEO, many people neglect, or outright ignore another crucial part of SEO: page optimization.</p>

<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll give a few tips, and a high level look at what page optimization is all about. I&#8217;ll explain some of the meaning behind it, and hopefully you&#8217;ll find something you&#8217;ve missed on your own site.</p>

<p><strong>Title Tag </strong></p>

<p>You can write a whole article about the title tag. In fact, later on I will. A good title tag serves two purposes. Foremost, it entices users to click on your page. Most search engines use your title tag as the inbound link. Secondly, it is a valuable part of the search engine algorithm. This means two things. <strong>Make your title enticing, and use keywords in it.</strong></p>

<p>_Extra tip: Use a different title tag for every page on your site.  _</p>

<p><strong>Meta Tags </strong></p>

<p>Fellow SEOs, start up your flamethrowers! <strong>Meta tags are not dead</strong>.  They certainly aren&#8217;t as relevant as they were in 1998, but they are still used. In fact, google uses the description tag quite a bit. If you don&#8217;t want google to choose for you, put the desired text in the tag. Meta tags don&#8217;t hold a lot of weight these days, in fact i somewhat doubt the keyword tag holds any weight at all. But it only takes about a minute to add them, so why not? <strong>Make metatags, and optimize them for your content, and the sales pitch you want shown in the listing. </strong></p>

<p>_Extra Tip: Use different meta tag data for every page on your site.  _</p>

<p><strong>Use a single, relevant H1 tag describing your content.  </strong></p>

<p>Pretty self explanatory. Use an H1 tag only once per page and make sure it states what that page is about. Spiders read H1s an factor them into the ranking. This is not always easy if you&#8217;re using a CMS or particular piece of software.</p>

<p>_Extra Tip: If the H1 text is too large, make it smaller with CSS. _</p>

<p><strong>Use H2, H3 tags for subheadings.  </strong></p>

<p>Remember in school, when they taught you do to outlines? Think of h2 and higher tags as subheadings, that&#8217;s what they were designed for. Organize the content well so that relevant text is placed below each of the topics outlined in the tags. This provides a schema for the spider to determine the relevancy of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Use bulleted lists. </strong></p>

<p>Bulleted lists are a benefit from an SEO standpoint, but also from a human standpoint. <strong>When you break up information into lists it makes it easier to follow</strong> and increases the chances the reader will process it,rather than skipping it over.</p>

<p><em>Extra Tip: Use bulleted lists with CSS to make menus. This uses much less code, and is more extensible later.</em></p>

<p><strong>Use text navigation, and structure it properly.</strong></p>

<p>Again like the outline theory, you want your main page to branch off into sub category pages, and have all subcategories linked from the main site. Make sure your navigation is easy to use so you don&#8217;t lose the customer.  Use text navigation, and if you must use graphics, name the images by the subject, and use alt tags to describe the link. Flash navigation, while nifty, is virtually ignored by spiders.</p>

<p>I hope this has helped a little in making sense of what page optimization is all about. In the ever changing SEO scene, it&#8217;s becoming more important than ever to make sure your landing page is set up right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re looking for better ways to optimize your google adsense performance, here is a quick tip. Google has created a new feature called section targeting, so you can emphasize, or de-emphasize areas of your site. This allows for placement targeting, and you can keep ads being served that are relevant to your site&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>For example, if you want certain text to be &#8220;counted&#8221; towards the text that google uses for ad serving, you place the following tags around it:</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_start -->


<p>The text you want highlighted, something about your subject</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_end -->


<p>Or alternatively you can have text you&#8217;d like ignored:</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->


<p>ignore this stuff</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_end -->


<p>I am not sure yet if this actually makes any difference. I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of text on this site that needs to be ignored, nearly all of it is relevant to to SEO or marketing. But I implemented it anyway to see if there is any tweaking or tuning that can be done.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using wordpress, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2006/11/14/google-adsense-targeting/">here is a plugin that does it for you</a>.  Let me know if you guys get good results with this. I&#8217;m going to be tweaking and optimizing mine in the coming month or so.</p>
