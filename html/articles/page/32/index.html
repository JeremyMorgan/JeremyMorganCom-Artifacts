  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in the early days of SEO, there was a very popular tactic for increasing web traffic. People were abusing meta tags and title tags, and filling the bottom of their pages with keywords. Such tactics would never get you anywhere today, but back then it really worked. And you could fill up your site with &#8220;britney spears&#8221; keywords and get a load of traffic. So that&#8217;s what people did.</p>

<p>A client of mine heard about this trick on the web. He asked me, to do this to all his pages. His website was selling widgets, but he wanted a chunk of the &#8220;britney spears&#8221; traffic, and &#8220;Pamela Anderson Pictures&#8221; etc. He figured with ten thousand new people a day, some of them were bound to buy some widgets. I explained that this was a futile effort and not only would he be getting a bunch of poorly targeted traffic, raising his bandwidth needlessly, but he made the site look really tacky. This was the reason I refused to do it, above all, if I was going to put my name on a website, I didn&#8217;t want it to look like crap, with 500 britney and porn keywords spammed all over the bottom of it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how that customer&#8217;s project turned out. He found someone to add those keywords to his site. If he did get any traffic, I doubt they bought widgets.  The funny thing is, that was the early 2000s, and now in 2007, I still get the same sort of requests, almost weekly. Why do people want to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Targeting is everything. </strong></p>

<p>If you get ten thousand people looking for Britney Spears photos, and they find your widgets, they are not going to stay. Unless this person has some sort of need or connection to your widget, they will hit the back button and go elsewhere. You&#8217;ll still be stuck with the bandwidth bill. And worse yet, if they are using the Google or Yahoo toolbars, the search engines will get this data back and start to think your site is of poor quality, because people don&#8217;t stay there.</p>

<p>Targeting is extremely important. If you target the wrong market, you can easily end up making expensive changes until you get it right.  It&#8217;s easier to change your strategy <em>before </em>you implement it. So don&#8217;t be afraid to take some time figuring it out. Your ideal market of course is one of good opportunity, that you are able to compete in. You don&#8217;t want to target too small of a segment, but you also don&#8217;t want to get into a market you cannot compete in.</p>

<p><strong>Adwords Targeting </strong></p>

<p>I tell my clients there are generally three routes you can go with adwords. You can put a whole pile of money into the biggest bids, on the best keywords. For some companies, this still only ends up being $20-$30 a day. For some it can reach thousands. And for some companies, this is the best strategy for them.</p>

<p>Another method, is to put in as many keywords, with very low bids, and get gobs of traffic for much cheaper. This might sound like a good deal to you, if you&#8217;re only paying five cents a click, and you are getting thousands of clicks a day for cheap, that&#8217;s probably the best deal right? I usually advise my clients against this.</p>

<p>The third method is to find the most variations on a targeted term, and put in midrange bids on each of them. This prevents you from spending all your budget on a few clicks, and spreads it out evenly, but among relevant phrases. For most businesses, this is the method I recommend.  Even for companies with an ultra tight budget, this can mean only 10-15  clicks a day for some people, but those clicks are interested customers, who are looking for their product.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend it is because they are targeted visitors. When a promoter drops 10,000 keywords into your adwords account, you&#8217;re likely to start drifting away from your core keywords. Unless you&#8217;re walmart and selling thousands of various items online, most likely you&#8217;re putting in keywords that are less relevant to your site. There are hundreds of ways to rephrase &#8220;tire shop in Boulder Colorado&#8221;  but eventually you&#8217;ll end up with phrases like &#8220;colorado tire flat highway&#8221; and who knows what you&#8217;ll get.  It&#8217;s better to keep focused on phrases people looking for your services or product might type in.</p>

<p><strong>Your keywords control your visitors. </strong></p>

<p>If you carefully choose keyword phrases and combinations, you&#8217;ll find that the people who click through are genuinely interested in your product.  Taking a keyword and finding many variations on it is what a good SEM will do for you. They will find a hundred ways to search for your boulder tire shop and try to get reasonable bids on it. And for some &#8220;hot terms&#8221; you may want to bid high. If you&#8217;re the tire shop owner, then &#8220;tire shop in boulder&#8221; is a good term you should spend some money on. They&#8217;re obviously looking for you. Someone searching for &#8220;tire shop in colorado&#8221; may not as lucrative, as the customer could be on the other side of the state, and unlikely to visit your shop.</p>

<p>The better the keywords, the better the customers. Its all about conversion, you can test this with tools like google&#8217;s website optimizer.  There are many ways to <a href="http://www.grokdotcom.com/2007/04/03/64-tips-for-getting-started-with-google-optimizer/">get the best of this program</a> with a little planning.</p>

<p>Here is a long list of <a href="http://www.conversion-rate-experts.com/articles/101-google-website-optimizer-tips/">google optimizer tips</a> that talks about lot about conversion rate. Less traffic with a better conversion rate can make you as much money as more traffic with a lower conversion rate. Targeting is vital to your conversion rate, and something to really think about when planning your ad campaigns.</p>

<p>In closing, when building your ad campaigns, try to get your conversion rates up as your main goal. Focus on getting as much traffic as you can afford, but when deciding between clicks and conversion rates, choose conversions. They&#8217;re the only thing that matters in the end anyway. Irrelevant traffic seldom pays the bills.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-01-02T22:32:59+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 2<span>nd</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to start off by saying I honestly don&#8217;t know whether text to code ratio affects rankings at all. Almost every piece of SEO advice I give out I have tested and proven, or at least came close to proving. This is one of the things I have not tested at all, but is certainly something interesting to consider.</p>

<p>What is text to code ratio?</p>

<p>Simply put, its the amount of text vs the amount of markup in your source code. Go to view-> source and take a look. As we all know,  this is how spiders see your site. Text to code ratio has zero effect on humans. This is why it&#8217;s so often overlooked.</p>

<p>With the sudden surge of table-less layouts, and the previous surge of CSS popularity, code is reducing all the time. That cluttered nonsense we wrote years ago is 5 times larger, from a text perspective. Let me show you this in action.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table width="600" border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="166" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some more text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="202" valign="top"&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is center text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;This is some more text&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="218" valign="top"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"&gt;The left menu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;font color="#ff0000"&gt;Blah blah blah.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look at that mess. It&#8217;s hard to believe we used to write that stuff, isn&#8217;t it? This comes in at a whopping 13.2% text, with the remaining size in code.</p>

<p>Here is that same code with CSS applied:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p class="rightpanel"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;The right menu

Blah blah blah.
&lt;p class="leftpanel"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;This is some text

This is some more text
&lt;p class="center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="heading"&gt;This is center text

This is some more text
</code></pre>

<p>Aside from all the other reasons for writing code in this style (extensibility, faster development, etc) it&#8217;s also a heck of a lot less code. This snippet comes in at 28.54%, more than double the amount of relevant text per file.</p>

<p>Jeremymorgan.com comes in at 20.16% (before this article was published). Lets see how that compares with the big boys.</p>

<p>CNN.com: <strong>9.37%</strong></p>

<p>MySpace.com: <strong>4.4%</strong></p>

<p>ESPN.com:  <strong>8.87%</strong>
I think you&#8217;re getting the point here. They are already huge sites, so they care little about SEO, and place an emphasis on formatting, which makes perfect sense. Maybe someday you&#8217;ll do that as well, but in the meantime it&#8217;s not a bad idea to think about code to text ratios and how they affect your site. If you are using a CMS, you have less control over it, but it&#8217;s still possible.</p>

<p><strong>Here is how you reduce your code to text ratio:</strong></p>

<p>Never style individual elements with html. Use CSS</p>

<p>Switch to a table-less layout, and do your layouts with CSS (There are other great reasons for it)</p>

<p>Dont comment your html code, or use worthless tags.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collinsinternet.com/code-to-text-ratio/">Here is how you check it </a></p>

<p>As I stated, I am not sure if it has any difference on your results, but I don&#8217;t see how it could harm them. I may do some testing in the future, though it will be tough to create a good control environment. My official word is: It sounds like a likely theory. It&#8217;s not something that will hold a tremendous amount of weight,  but any edge you can get on your competition is good. Email me and let me know your thoughts or results!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re running WordPress, you can just dump them in the software. Go to <strong>options->writing</strong> and scroll down to &#8221;<strong>update services</strong>&#8221; and paste them in.</p>

<p>Good luck with your blogging!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-12-23T04:26:36+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 23<span>rd</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wordpress is an excellent tool for blogging. It&#8217;s what I use on this site, for ease of use, and all the nifty plugins. But one problem wordpress has, is duplicate content issues. In this article I will tell you how to resolve these issues so you don&#8217;t get punished by search engines for something you&#8217;re not consciously doing.</p>

<p><strong>What is duplicate content and why is it bad?   </strong></p>

<p>Back in the day, certain unscrupulous webmasters came up with the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doorway_pages">doorway pages</a>. The idea behind these pages is creating hundreds or even thousands of pages with the same content on it, and maybe changing a thing or two on each page so the search engines would spider them all and give you more traffic. Google responded accordingly.</p>

<p>So now, if you have duplicated content on your site, you will be punished for it in the rankings. Wordpress has a few problems with duplicating content through archives, trackbacks and comments, so here is our solution.</p>

<p><strong>Step one: Fix your page header.</strong></p>

<p>Go to Presentation -> Theme Editor. From there select &#8220;header.php&#8221;. Put the following code before the closing of the <head> tag:</p>

<p>&lt;?php</p>

<p>if((is_home() &amp;&amp; ($paged &lt; 2 )) || is_single() || is_page() || is_category()){
echo &#8217;<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />&#8217;;
}else {</p>

<p>echo &#8217;<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow" />&#8217;;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>?></p>

<p>This will will tell the search engines to spider the index page and follow all the links, but it will not follow the links to archives or &#8220;next page&#8221; links which are duplicated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Robots.txt </strong></p>

<p>Put the following in your robots.txt to exclude the appropriate pages:</p>

<p><em>User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-
Disallow: /search
Disallow: /feed
Disallow: /comments/feed
Disallow: /feed/$
Disallow: /<em>/feed/$
Disallow: /</em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /<em>/trackback/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/feed/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/trackback/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/</em>/feed/$
Disallow: /<em>/</em>/<em>/feed/rss/$
Disallow: /</em>/<em>/</em>/trackback/$</em></p>

<p>If you need help editing your robots.txt <a href="http://adambrown.info/b/widgets/kb-robots-txt/">use a plugin to do it for you</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Redirect to a canonical URL</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a good tip for any site, not just a wordpress site. You want to make sure www.jeremymorgan.com/page.htm and jeremymorgan.com/page.htm don&#8217;t get spidered and indexed seperately. Edit your .htaccess file, and add the following (remove jeremymorgan.com and replace it with your domain)</p>

<p>_ RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.jeremymorgan.com$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jeremymorgan.com/$1 [R,L]
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]_</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks">permalinks</a> most of this code will already be there. You only have to add the following two lines to the top:</p>

<p>_ RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.jeremymorgan.com$ [NC]
<em>_ RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.jeremymorgan.com/$1 [R,L]</em></p>

<p>Again, replace jeremymorgan.com with your own site, otherwise you&#8217;ll be sending me all your traffic, and I think your readers might get a little angry.</p>

<p>Using the tips above, you can reduce the chance of being penalized for having duplicate content. Of course you don&#8217;t want to use doorway pages or spammy content, but it will look as if you do, so make these changes as soon as you can. This is not a huge traffic boost type of tip, but more like insurance for the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the SEO world, so much talk revolves around inbound links. It seems the main focus is always on inbounds, how to get them, how to keep them, and how to attract links from &#8220;authority&#8221; sites.</p>

<p>While inbound linking is crucial to SEO, many people neglect, or outright ignore another crucial part of SEO: page optimization.</p>

<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll give a few tips, and a high level look at what page optimization is all about. I&#8217;ll explain some of the meaning behind it, and hopefully you&#8217;ll find something you&#8217;ve missed on your own site.</p>

<p><strong>Title Tag </strong></p>

<p>You can write a whole article about the title tag. In fact, later on I will. A good title tag serves two purposes. Foremost, it entices users to click on your page. Most search engines use your title tag as the inbound link. Secondly, it is a valuable part of the search engine algorithm. This means two things. <strong>Make your title enticing, and use keywords in it.</strong></p>

<p>_Extra tip: Use a different title tag for every page on your site.  _</p>

<p><strong>Meta Tags </strong></p>

<p>Fellow SEOs, start up your flamethrowers! <strong>Meta tags are not dead</strong>.  They certainly aren&#8217;t as relevant as they were in 1998, but they are still used. In fact, google uses the description tag quite a bit. If you don&#8217;t want google to choose for you, put the desired text in the tag. Meta tags don&#8217;t hold a lot of weight these days, in fact i somewhat doubt the keyword tag holds any weight at all. But it only takes about a minute to add them, so why not? <strong>Make metatags, and optimize them for your content, and the sales pitch you want shown in the listing. </strong></p>

<p>_Extra Tip: Use different meta tag data for every page on your site.  _</p>

<p><strong>Use a single, relevant H1 tag describing your content.  </strong></p>

<p>Pretty self explanatory. Use an H1 tag only once per page and make sure it states what that page is about. Spiders read H1s an factor them into the ranking. This is not always easy if you&#8217;re using a CMS or particular piece of software.</p>

<p>_Extra Tip: If the H1 text is too large, make it smaller with CSS. _</p>

<p><strong>Use H2, H3 tags for subheadings.  </strong></p>

<p>Remember in school, when they taught you do to outlines? Think of h2 and higher tags as subheadings, that&#8217;s what they were designed for. Organize the content well so that relevant text is placed below each of the topics outlined in the tags. This provides a schema for the spider to determine the relevancy of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Use bulleted lists. </strong></p>

<p>Bulleted lists are a benefit from an SEO standpoint, but also from a human standpoint. <strong>When you break up information into lists it makes it easier to follow</strong> and increases the chances the reader will process it,rather than skipping it over.</p>

<p><em>Extra Tip: Use bulleted lists with CSS to make menus. This uses much less code, and is more extensible later.</em></p>

<p><strong>Use text navigation, and structure it properly.</strong></p>

<p>Again like the outline theory, you want your main page to branch off into sub category pages, and have all subcategories linked from the main site. Make sure your navigation is easy to use so you don&#8217;t lose the customer.  Use text navigation, and if you must use graphics, name the images by the subject, and use alt tags to describe the link. Flash navigation, while nifty, is virtually ignored by spiders.</p>

<p>I hope this has helped a little in making sense of what page optimization is all about. In the ever changing SEO scene, it&#8217;s becoming more important than ever to make sure your landing page is set up right.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re looking for better ways to optimize your google adsense performance, here is a quick tip. Google has created a new feature called section targeting, so you can emphasize, or de-emphasize areas of your site. This allows for placement targeting, and you can keep ads being served that are relevant to your site&#8217;s content.</p>

<p>For example, if you want certain text to be &#8220;counted&#8221; towards the text that google uses for ad serving, you place the following tags around it:</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_start -->


<p>The text you want highlighted, something about your subject</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_end -->


<p>Or alternatively you can have text you&#8217;d like ignored:</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_start(weight=ignore) -->


<p>ignore this stuff</p>

<!-- google_ad_section_end -->


<p>I am not sure yet if this actually makes any difference. I don&#8217;t have a whole lot of text on this site that needs to be ignored, nearly all of it is relevant to to SEO or marketing. But I implemented it anyway to see if there is any tweaking or tuning that can be done.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using wordpress, <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/2006/11/14/google-adsense-targeting/">here is a plugin that does it for you</a>.  Let me know if you guys get good results with this. I&#8217;m going to be tweaking and optimizing mine in the coming month or so.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-12-19T03:05:17+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 19<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So you really think you can make hundreds a day off adsense? Really?</p>

<p>Actually, some people are making thousands. Have you heard of a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2005/09/01/im-a-six-figure-blogger/">six figure blogger</a>? There are a few of them out there. Adsense earnings are difficult to master, but certainly not impossible. Anyone can do it.</p>

<p>Here I&#8217;m going to outline some basic steps for going from zero to hero with your blog, using adsense. I won&#8217;t go into too much detail, but this is the first article in what will be a series.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Get hosting. </strong></p>

<p>This step isn&#8217;t entirely necessary, there are free hosting alternatives out there. With <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/hosting/shared.asp?ci=9009">godaddy offering hosting so cheap</a> you may as well pony up the 4 bucks a month to not have to deal with hosting issues. Get a domain, and some hosting to start. So <strong>it costs around 15 dollars</strong> to start this project.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Get wordpress, and install it. Or pay someone to install it.</strong></p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t the most technical person in the world, you can pay someone $20-$50. Mention this article, and I&#8217;ll install it for you for $25.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Find something you love, that you&#8217;ll love writing about.</strong></p>

<p>It really doesn&#8217;t matter what it is. If you love it, you&#8217;ll want to write about it. And write you should, posting a new article every day for a year. Yes, you read that right. At the very least, do an article every other day. This is crucial to your success.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: build your sitemap and submit it to google and yahoo!</strong></p>

<p>Build a <a href="www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">google sitemap</a> and submit it to both google and yahoo. Since you&#8217;re using wordpress anyway, why not use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">wordpress sitemap plugin</a>? It works awesome and makes sitemaps a snap. This ensures you&#8217;ll get recognized quick.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Start writing. </strong></p>

<p>Write to your heart&#8217;s content. Talk about what&#8217;s going on in the industry, or new things you can babble about relating to the subject. Make sure your spelling and grammar are good. Soon, if you produce enough interesting content, people will start linking in.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Join blog directories.</strong></p>

<p>Join as many blog directories as you can find, and exchange links with them. This serves two purposes, it gets your name out there, and gets traffic coming in. Plus the back links from google don&#8217;t hurt either. The more the merrier. I think I have listings in twenty or so at this point. But there really is no limit on how many directories you can list in.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Utilize social bookmarks. </strong></p>

<p>Create accounts on the major social bookmarking sites such as digg or delicious. Get a big list together (I&#8217;ll soon have a submission tool on here) and submit every article to them. This brings in both new traffic, and back links that will help you in the future. This is a good free way to build traffic. Make sure you aren&#8217;t submitting crap, or you may get banned from the sites. Try to make it interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8: Learn to improve your writing. </strong></p>

<p>The better the writing, the more people will come back. The bottom line is, if you can&#8217;t be interesting, no amount of article posting will build traffic. Take some notes from the pros, or read up on some of the more popular writing sites. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">CopyBlogger</a>
is one of my absolute favorite reads.</p>

<p><strong>Step 9: Become an authority on the subject.</strong></p>

<p>This one takes a few years at the very least. But try to become an expert on the subject, taking in and dispersing as much information as you can. Try your best to become an authority on the subject. Google likes it, and you&#8217;ll earn more fans and natural links. Did you see the link I put up there to copyblogger? As you may have guessed, he didn&#8217;t pay a dime for that. I simply wanted to link it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Never give up</strong></p>

<p>This is the toughest part. Using this simple formula with these steps, and I have no doubt within a year you can be making hundreds or more on adsense. That&#8217;s what the program is for! Try to get as much natural traffic as you can. SEO is important, but for adsense to perform best, you need regular traffic.</p>

<p>Lets do a little math. Lets say every post you make gets 1000 views over it&#8217;s lifetime. Thats a very very low estimate. If you wrote a page a day for a year, thats 365,000 views. At my current adsense rate, thats 5,475 dollars. And that&#8217;s a low estimate. Work at it, and you can beat that by far!!</p>

<p>Good luck! I&#8217;ll give some more detailed advice soon.</p>

<time datetime="2007-12-18T15:38:11+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 18<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you got yourself a new website set up and you want to be at the bottom of the &#8220;shower head&#8221; search results. This may not get you banned altogether, but it will at least get your site deranked enough that new visitors will stop bothering you.</p>

<h3>1. Build hundreds of pages with the same content.</h3>

<p>Build as many pages as you can, with basically the same content. Build one for &#8220;shower heads in Oregon&#8221;, then build another for &#8220;shower heads in California&#8221;. Build one for every state, and all the big cities in that state. Doing this should get your site banned in a month or two if you do it right.</p>

<h3>2. Buy 145 domains, and point them all at the same site.</h3>

<p>Another old SEO trick that works well. Since you are selling shower heads, you should get:</p>

<p>shower-heads.com</p>

<p>buy-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>where-to-buy-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>where-to-find-free-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>You get the idea. Build up enough of these and submit them all to google and yahoo, so they can index them and properly punish your site.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Keep your keyword density as high as possible. </strong></h3>

<p>Who cares what the text sounds like, keep it optimized. Here is an example of BAD text:</p>

<p>_&#8221;At Jeremy&#8217;s Shower heads, we have many name brand shower heads to choose from, and you can order online&#8221;. _</p>

<p>That almost sounds like something a human would say. Try this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;At Jeremy&#8217;s Shower Heads, we have the most shower heads out of any shower heads manufacturer, or shower heads dealer. Come check out our shower heads store and look at all our shower heads and shower heads supplies we have available. Need more shower heads, or a special shower head? We can special order shower heads too.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Not only do you have more text, but we have 15.5% keyword density for &#8220;shower heads&#8221;. That should be enough to trip the spam filter in most major engines. If it doesnt, try adding &#8220;shower heads&#8221; into random spots in the paragraph.</p>

<h3>4. Spam your links in wordpress or other blog comments.</h3>

<p>Nothing says &#8220;crappy spam site&#8221; more, and if you do this enough, the search engines will notice. Since very few people probably click those links anyway, you wont have any new visitors bothering you either.</p>

<h3>5. Join as many link exchanges as possible.</h3>

<p>Try to get as many link exchanges going, with as many sites as possible. If you run a shower head site, trading links with a quilting directory makes perfect sense. Enough irrelevant links, and you should see a good drop in rankings you should actually get naturally.</p>

<h3>6. Use as many free for all &#8220;FFA&#8221; sites as possible.</h3>

<p>Same theory, link exchanges with irrelevant sites won&#8217;t get you banned, but they will certainly drop your rankings.</p>

<h3>7. Target popular keywords and enjoy the extra traffic.</h3>

<p>Dont fill your site with keywords about shower heads. Throw in paris hilton, britney spears, and mortage rates. With all those extra people coming in, you&#8217;re bound to sell a shower head or two. Targeted marketing is for people who want to be bothered by customers all the time.</p>

<h3>8. Generate random text</h3>

<p>The more text, the better. Generating random text is a great way to get new people into your site, but dont worry they&#8217;ll close the browser once they read the gibberish. And google will punish your rankings also.</p>

<h3>9. Build cloak pages!</h3>

<p>A cloaked page is a page designed to be seen by search engines, and optimized, then a real user sees an entirely different page. Again, all the people coming to your super britney spears page listed on google, will surely be happy that you have such a wide selection of shower heads. And soon google will catch on to your cloaked pages also.</p>

<h3>10. Hide your text</h3>

<p>This one is awesome! There is no way the search engines will ever figure out your white text on a white background. This secret text is your key to getting banned, and rather quickly if someone finds it and tattles on you. So get that huge keyword list ready and start loading up the page!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I hope this has helped. The sarcasm even got old to me by the end of the list, but these are things you should never, ever consider on your site. Many of the tactics haven&#8217;t worked well for years, and many of them are futile anyway, as you&#8217;re only getting traffic that isn&#8217;t interested in your product. Keep these in mind when talking to an SEO also.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every month, thousands of dollars are being thrown at junk SEOs. Have you been approached by an SEO yet? How do you know whether they are good or bad? How do you know whether they are a scammer or the real deal? Here are some basic things to look for when dealing with an SEO:</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t fall for &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; listings. </strong></p>

<p>I never guarantee listings. No reputable SEO will. I know this sounds silly, but let me explain.  We don&#8217;t own google, Yahoo or MSN. So how can we possibly guarantee anything? There are thousands or more competing for your exact search term. And there are thousands of variables that affect your ranking. No SEO can guarantee anything. Sure, they can guarantee positive movement, or better exposure, but nobody can guarantee you a ranking. (This does not apply to SEM / PPC optimization of course).</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t do link building schemes.</strong></p>

<p>When an SEO tells you they can get you valuable incoming links, they aren&#8217;t lying. Many SEO companies have a large set of sites that are built into a link network. And indeed, they can raise your ranking by linking in to you. So why is this bad? Because search engines, especially google, are getting better every day at detecting them and you could end up penalizing yourself. SE&#8217;s consider this link manipulation, and artificially inflating the rank of the site. Earlier this year, and most recently, google shifted their algorithm to reduce the rank of sites who buy or sell  &#8220;PR links&#8221;.</p>

<p>A good SEO  will certainly try to get you more inbound links. It&#8217;s a crucial part of SEO. But they need to be &#8220;natural&#8221; inbounds. When I work with clients, I encourage them to create content people actually want to link to, give them avenues for promotion, and let other webmasters do the rest. If your site is good, people will link to it. And thats exactly why google values inbound links so much, they want a democratic system of finding good sites. So ask about that.</p>

<p><strong>Dont pay for resubmission.</strong></p>

<p>Some say you shouldn&#8217;t pay an ongoing fee for SEO at all. I disagree with this. However, you do want to ask exactly what it is you&#8217;re paying for. When I do maintenance, I ensure that all new pages are in the sitemap, and track their indexing status, and I check ranks to spot trends, and examine traffic analytics. I make suggestions, changes, add content, and services like that, and I tell the customer exactly what they&#8217;re getting. If you are paying some schlep to &#8220;resubmit their site to search engines&#8221; then stop today. No amount of submitting is going to raise your rankings, and as google has said many times, you only need to submit once.</p>

<p><strong>Dont fall for &#8220;tricks&#8221;.</strong></p>

<p>This one is self explanatory. If an SEO approaches you with a set of &#8220;tricks&#8221; to get your site to the top, beware. While these &#8220;tricks&#8221; might be effective, they can get you banned as well. You have to measure risk vs. reward, something every business owner does daily. Do you want that extra 1000 hits to be the last ones the search engine sends you? Ask questions, and do research. Black Hat SEO is effective, but its not good for a long term business plan, or sites that want to be around for a while. Most Black Hats use disposable domains and discard them once banned.</p>

<p><strong>Ask them what they are doing. </strong></p>

<p>Anytime someone provides a service, you should know what they&#8217;re getting. And if you are going to hand over the keys to your site, you better have some idea what they&#8217;re doing in there. If an SEO tells you its &#8220;secret&#8221; and he cannot divulge what he&#8217;s doing, skip him/her altogether. Offer to sign an NDA, and if they still won&#8217;t tell you, dont buy.</p>

<p><strong>Research.  </strong></p>

<p>Again, basic business sense. If an SEO approaches you with a sales pitch, by all means give them a shot, especially if you are interested. There are a lot of really good SEOs out there who are legitimate and helpful. But don&#8217;t buy right away. Do some research, ask around and find out what their competitors charge, what they&#8217;re doing, and make sure they aren&#8217;t some scam group that ex customers have outed on the web. An ounce of prevention&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll touch more on some of these subjects later. But always be cautious, with any new industry you have people looking to take advantage of unsuspecting customers.</p>
