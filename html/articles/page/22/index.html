  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote an article about my <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/blog/linux/old-g4-debian-linux-dirt-cheap-development-machine/">dirt cheap dev machine</a> that I bought on Craigslist for $200. What happened was my laptop went out and I was in the middle of a project. Because I am really picky and like to research new purchases very thoroughly, I decided I needed an interim machine. I ended up buying a G4 powerbook and slapping Linux on it and got my stuff done.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/powermac-g4-150x150.jpg"My" title="G4 Powermac&#34;" alt="G4 Powermac&#34;"></p>

<p>When I first turned on the computer it had a copy of OSX Panther on it. It took me 10 minutes or so to decide it was time to go, once I got it connected to the internet it was horribly slow, and most of the websites didn&#8217;t format properly, and many didn&#8217;t work at all. So I did what any self respecting geek would do and grabbed a copy of Linux to breathe life into this old dog. First it was a copy of Debian PPC, then Yellow Dog Linux. I installed what I needed and got the project done.</p>

<p>Then I got a new laptop and the G4 went in the closet for a few months. I recently decided to break it out again, and fix some of the issues it had, and maybe build some new versions of packages. I ended up getting hooked big time, and lately I&#8217;ve been spending a lot more time on that old G4. Why?</p>

<h3>Advantages of Using Dinosaurs</h3>

<p>There are quite a few advantages of using old stuff. This G4 was originally released in 2004, that&#8217;s 8 long years. In 2004 we weren&#8217;t doing a fraction of the cool stuff we&#8217;re doing now with the web and things like Facebook and Twitter didn&#8217;t even exist, so the computer wasn&#8217;t exactly designed for today&#8217;s stuff. Linux of course solves this problem.</p>

<p>But the next problem with this particular machine is, the motorola PowerPC processor. Apple stopped using them in 2006, and even most versions of Linux built for the PPC stopped developing in 2010 or so.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/99ee98d8964611e1b10e123138105d6b_7-300x300.jpg" title="&#34;My G4 Powermac&#34;" alt="&#34;My G4 Powermac&#34;"></p>

<p>But I want the newest stuff, so that means compling from source. When you do that, you start hitting dependencies and going on a wild goose chase for software, backtracking all over the net upgrading everything, tweaking and tuning and pulling your hair out to get one simple package to work.</p>

<p>If that sounds like fun, you&#8217;re as much of a geek as me. I&#8217;ve upgraded nearly every component of this old mac and it&#8217;s taken me HOURS to do it. But I&#8217;ve learned a tremendous amount in the process. I&#8217;ve learned about the hardware, learned more about Linux and learned more about the packages themselves. I&#8217;ve also learned more about optimizing my system.</p>

<p>Did I mention cost? I&#8217;ve got a machine that you can browse the internet, watch movies, make websites and even develop software on for $200. Hard to beat.</p>

<p>Drivers for hardware are pretty well established as well, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about hardware too new to support, or surprises in the drivers.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When you use old stuff like this, you save a lot of money. You also save the environment by using something that might otherwise be thrown away. Finally, you learn more about your hardware and learn how to squeeze every drop of performance out of it. If you want a decent daily driver you can get your favorite distribution of Linux and put together something pretty neat and stable.</p>

<p>Obviously if you&#8217;re a gamer or doing something like video editing or animation there aren&#8217;t many advantages of using older stuff. But for the rest of us it can save you some money and of course be really fun. Don&#8217;t throw it away, give it a try!</p>

<p>There are a few different ways to do things in the Linux world and if you ask for the best way, you&#8217;ll get several different answers. Linux folk tend to be pretty opinionated and become polarized about issues, which creates difficulties and makes for one more thing to add to the list of reasons the masses don&#8217;t publicly adopt Linux.</p>

<p>How you build your software is one of those dividing issues. People who favor package managers talk of ease of upgrading, not thinking about dependencies and stability. People who favor building from source talk of control and peak performance. The purpose of this article is to help you figure out which camp you should be in.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve been a Linux user since the mid 90s and also a software developer by trade so I&#8217;m pretty confident in building from source so that&#8217;s my preference. Plus I&#8217;m a bit of a control freak which is one of the big reasons I use Linux in the first place. Do I always recommend it for others? No, of course not.</p>

<p>This task can be pretty daunting for a beginner, and possibly not worth the trouble. Plus there are some really great package managers for Linux out there: rpm, yum, aptitude and dpkg to name a few, and they are pretty great.</p>

<h2>Using a package manager and/or precompiled binaries.</h2>

<p>So you just burned that cool new Ubuntu CD and can&#8217;t wait to install it. You fire it up and notice all kinds of cool stuff you gotta download so you get crackin. You install a bunch of software and get everything where you want and have your system set up.</p>

<p>Do you have a good system set up? Yes.
Do you have what you&#8217;re looking for? Yes.
Did you spend a lot of time on it? No.
Is it still better than a Windows box? Yes.</p>

<p>So is there anything wrong with doing things this way? Of course not. If you&#8217;re a casual or new user this is likely the best way to do it. You install everything without worrying too much about dependencies, libraries or compilers. Someone else has done the work for you and that&#8217;s fine with you. You&#8217;re just going to browse the web and maybe learn some PHP or Python, so the system is ready.</p>

<h3>Advantages:</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>You save yourself time compiling stuff</strong> - Most is pre compiled for you so hours become minutes.
<strong>Easy Installation</strong> - You don&#8217;t spend a bunch of time editing text files and chasing down libraries.
<strong>Dependencies?</strong> - They are of little concern to you.
<strong>Super simple</strong> - Installation was as easy as pushing a button.
<strong>Peace of Mind-</strong> You probably installed stable and secure software. Generally package managers recommend stable, tested stuff.
<strong>Didn&#8217;t have to use VI</strong> - You don&#8217;t know a lick of coding so it&#8217;s a good thing you didn&#8217;t have to do any.</p></blockquote>

<p>You&#8217;re probably ok doing it this way especially as a casual user, however there are some downsides. If this were the only and best way to do it, we wouldn&#8217;t have this article.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>You have old stuff</strong> - You may not have the newest software. You have what the distribution or package manager decided to give you.
<strong>You have Slow Stuff</strong> - You have precompiled binaries that may not be fully optimized for your processor.
<strong>Too much fat</strong> - You have a lot of stuff on your hard drive, and a lot of it you will never need.
<strong>Memory Hogs</strong> - The programs have a lot of extra stuff compiled in, so you may be using more memory than you need to.
<strong>Toaster Effect </strong>- You have things set up with all the default options, which may not be exactly what you want.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Compiling from Source.</h2>

<p>So, let&#8217;s say you take another route and decide to compile everything from source. So what you do in this case is go out and hit each website and get the newest (or newest stable) versions of the source, download it and compile it for your system. At the end of this you also have a great running system but what are the pros and cons of this method?</p>

<h3>Advantages:</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>You have the newest stuff - </strong>You can go with the latest stable or the very bleeding edge which can be good or bad. You could have untested (but really new) stuff that&#8217;s full of bugs or you could have the best product the programmers can offer. Your mileage may vary.
<strong>You have software that&#8217;s optimized for your processor</strong> - Since this was compiled on your system for your system it&#8217;s running as fast as it can. With some programs it&#8217;s useless with others the added performance is quite noticeable.
<strong>You have only what you need -</strong> Unless you went and got software for the hell of it, you only have what you needed to successfully build the software. This saves on hard drive space and eases organization.
<strong>You have configured it your way, and eliminated a lot of fat.</strong> You&#8217;re using less hard drive space and memory and you sleep well at night knowing you&#8217;re using your system in the most efficient way possible. For some of us this is very important.
<strong>You probably learned something</strong> - As I mentioned I have been using Linux since the mid 90s, and a couple days ago I updated my GCC to the latest version and I learned something about MPFR and how it ties in with other libraries. You never stop learning, and by compiling stuff by hand you&#8217;ll learn a lot about how your computer works, and how software is set up.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course compiling from source isn&#8217;t the silver bullet, end all solution either. There are some key complaints to compiling from source that are very valid.</p>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>

<blockquote><p><strong>Time</strong> - Wow! You spent 4 hours setting up a new version of GCC? Really? Yes, I did just that yesterday and if you compile stuff from source you will spend a ton of time babysitting it. Expect to spend a lot of time watching lines go by, and restarting it when something fails. Yes you can do other stuff during compiling but your computer is (or should be) off limits while you compile all this code. You can spend 40 working hours setting up a decent system easily by building from source, It&#8217;s more common than you&#8217;d think.
<strong>Frustration</strong> - You&#8217;ve had to hunt down libraries, chase dependencies and hack config files right and left. Nothing is ever as simple as running ./configure, make and make install. You had a frustrating speed bump every step of the way and had to hit Google 20 times to make this thing work. (Don&#8217;t worry I still have to hit Google sometimes to make stuff work and I do this for a living).
<strong>Dependencies</strong> - You&#8217;ll discover them after waiting 40 minutes for a package to compile and see an Error 2 at the last minute.
<strong>Updating software</strong> - Sure it&#8217;s all neat and dandy once you get everything built and running, but once you need to upgrade one of those pieces of software you&#8217;ll find out that you&#8217;re in for lots more time than you imagined. There is no apt-get updates for you buddy! Start recompiling everything.
<strong>Bleeding edge</strong> - There&#8217;s a chance that latest and greatest software you just put on the production server runs like garbage and has some serious security issues. You&#8217;re pretty much stuck with it until you&#8217;ve got the time to roll stuff back.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>OK, so which method is better? It depends on your application. I&#8217;ve been known to install an OS and use all the vanilla stuff and do just fine. I even use XAMPP for personal dev machines sometimes because it&#8217;s just so easy and quick. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this if your goal is to use the machine as a simple tool to get a job done.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also been known to do things like I have recently, where I spent HOURS working on my PowerBook G4 updating everything from source. Since I&#8217;m running a version of Yellow Dog Linux from 2008 there was tons of old stuff on there, but I had to redo it all and squeeze some performance out of it. I hand crafted every configure parameter and compiled and recompiled binaries making sure everything was pristine and perfect. I have a very optimized machine, especially considering it&#8217;s 9 years old, but I paid for it with time.</p>

<p>If I were to factor in the amount of time I spent and apply the amount my employer pays me per hour to work, I could have easily bought a brand new laptop with Windows 7 on it that would outperform this machine by leaps. But what fun would that be?</p>

<p>In conclusion you have to do what&#8217;s best for you. If your operating system and machine are merely tools to do a task that you don&#8217;t really care about, just install your favorite Linux distro with all the defaults and get to work. You&#8217;re still getting a great system (if you choose Linux or Unix). If you are working with old hardware, need the maximum performance or are just a perfectionist like me, build it from source and enjoy squeezing every drop of performance out of it. Public facing production servers should always be running stuff compiled from source in my opinion.</p>

<p>In the end you have a choice, which is what Linux is really all about.</p>

<p>Here is a listing of all the programs I had installed and it gives you a good idea of what the typical programmer would use to do his/her job. At this time I am primarily developing in Linux, but in a previous position with this same company I was developing ASP/C# stuff and many of those programs were still installed so it shows a good variety of stuff. My reason for posting is to not only show the large variety of programs a typical developer might use, but also give you some ideas, there may be things you&#8217;ve never used before and decide to check out. Many of them are free/open source.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A NYC Taxi driver wrote:</p>

<p>I arrived at the address and honked the horn. After waiting a few minutes I honked again. Since this was going to be my last ride of my shift I thought about just driving away, but instead I put the car in park and walked up to the door and knocked.. &#8220;Just a minute&#8221;, answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/a-sweet-lesson-in-patience.jpg" title="A sweet lesson in patience" ></p>

<p>After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie.</p>

<p>By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.</p>

<p>There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you carry my bag out to the car?&#8221; she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.</p>

<p>She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.</p>

<p>She kept thanking me for my kindness. &#8220;It&#8221;s nothing&#8221;, I told her.. &#8220;I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother to be treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re such a good boy, she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address and then asked, &#8220;Could you drive through downtown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the shortest way,&#8221; I answered quickly..</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in no hurry. I&#8217;m on my way to a hospice&#8221;.</p>

<p>I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any family left,&#8221; she continued in a soft voice..&#8221;The doctor says I don&#8217;t have very long.&#8221; I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What route would you like me to take?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.</p>

<p>We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes she&#8217;d ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.</p>

<p>As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired.Let&#8217;s go now&#8221;. We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.</p>

<p>Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move.</p>

<p>They must have been expecting her.</p>

<p>I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do I owe you?&#8221; She asked, reaching into her purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to make a living,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other passengers,&#8221; I responded.</p>

<p>Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug.She held onto me tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light.. Behind me, a door shut.It was the sound of the closing of a life..</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of that day,I could hardly talk.What if that woman had gotten an angry driver,or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away?</p>

<p>On a quick review, I don&#8221;t think that I have done anything more important in my life.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What I&#8217;m going to say here flies in the face of much of what I have been posting here the last few years. It may not be what you want to hear, but it&#8217;s the truth. Most people don&#8217;t care about your website and you might be wasting your time working on it, but there&#8217;s something you can do about it.</p>

<h3>The Main Idea</h3>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-24.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-24.jpg" alt="Cocktail Party" /></a></p>

<p>Imagine you&#8217;re at a party with a couple hundred attendees at a nice house. You know people at the party, but there are a lot of strangers as well and everyone seems to be having a good time.</p>

<p>You just bought a new exotic car that you just want to show off, you know your friends are going to love it. You even want to show it to some strangers too, maybe make some new cruising buddies. How will you get the most attention possible?</p>

<p>There are a few ways you could do it, with varying results.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Leave the car at your house and invite people to come over and see it.</strong></p>

<p>If you choose this option a  few might decide to leave the party and come check it out. This would most likely be either your loyal friends and people really interested in the car. You might gather up a handful of people to go with you, but it would be a fraction of the overall attendees. It&#8217;s not that your car isn&#8217;t awesome, it&#8217;s just that people are already at a party having a good time, so why would they want to leave?</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Drive the car to the party and invite people to come outside to see it. </strong></p>

<p>This method would be much more effective largely because it&#8217;s more convenient for them; all they really have to do is go outside and take a look. It requires a small commitment and it&#8217;s easy to back out of, if your car sucks they can just go back inside to the party. This method would get far more people than the road trip to your house.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3: Set up some interactive cameras in your garage and pipe the feed to your iPad.</strong></p>

<p>Now you&#8217;ve got the home run idea. You break out the ipad and start showing off the system to your friends. Your friends are enthralled by every angle of your beautiful Italian masterpiece of a car as you play a couple videos of it driving and show some specs on it.  People start to crowd around you to see what everyone is looking at.</p>

<p>Not only are you showing off your car, but using a neat gimmick to do so. You&#8217;re giving people all the information you could give them from your garage, yet they never had to even leave the room. Commitment consists of peering over at an ipad, they don&#8217;t even have to set their drink down.  People see other people looking at it and they get curious too, next thing you know you&#8217;ve met tons of people more interested in your car.</p>

<p>Not only did you show off your car to a bunch of people, but you&#8217;ve actually added to the fun of this party.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t caught the parallels yet, your website is the car, and the party is Facebook.  Social Media is the party everyone is at, do you want to keep trying to drag everyone to your house? Nobody cares about your website until you&#8217;ve pulled them in.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Who Visits Your Website Now?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re like most websites most of your visitors will fall into one of these groups, especially if you&#8217;re running an eCommerce site.  Let&#8217;s use a site a Home and Garden store as an example and take a look at the type of customers they might have.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-1.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-1.jpg" alt="Who Visits Your Website? " /></a></p>

<h3></h3>

<p><strong>Hardcore Visitors -</strong> These people check your site religiously looking for new products, deals and more. They love your site, they love your brand and company. They tell everyone they know about you and are often early adopters. They know what you have in your store better than you do.</p>

<p><strong>The Regulars -</strong> These are the folks who are constantly involved in projects and frequent your website to check prices and see what kind of specials you have.  Like the hardcore visitors they like your company and go to you first.</p>

<p><strong>Tire Kickers -  </strong>We all know the type, these folks are just looking at the pictures on your site and maybe sending you an email or calling you just to ask countless questions. They aren&#8217;t going to buy anything and they are most likely reading your website from 3000 miles away.</p>

<p><strong>Information Seekers - </strong>These are the people Google sends you, they&#8217;re looking for what you sell, how much are you selling it for and where are you located. What are your hours? This is some of the information they&#8217;re seeking and many of them will turn into customers if you give them what they want.</p>

<p>So you might be asking yourself, Jeremy why did you say nobody cares about my website then tell me about all the people who go to it? The answer is simple: out of all these people the amount you can truly engage with is very small. If you set up forums, how many people would sign up and start participating? How many would get their friends to join?</p>

<p>If you answered a fraction of a percent you&#8217;d be correct. In all my years of experience I&#8217;ve never seen more than about .3% of a site&#8217;s audience sign up for their forum or message board. This is because they simply don&#8217;t care enough. These people might be interested what you charge for a bag of barkdust, but they certainly aren&#8217;t going to sign up for your forums and visit your website every day. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s Facebook or something.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>So what do you do to get them to care?</h3>

<p>This one is pretty easy but requires you to change your outlook on your whole web strategy. Instead of thinking of your website as a hub that you need to draw people into, reverse it a little. You need to create a social media presence, especially on Facebook and Twitter, and start focusing on that first.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard me right, you need to focus on your social media presence and think of your site as a simple endpoint, or a &#8220;get more information area&#8221;. Your new strategy should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a Page on Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Suggest it to all your friends</p></li>
<li><p>Put it on business cards and signs</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for Twitter and link it to Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Do daily or weekly updates to the page that get people engaged</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you focus on your niche, you can come up with a lot of things to say on a Facebook page. You could talk about your barkdust prices but that&#8217;s just going to get people to ignore you. You could ask them to come into your store every day, and you&#8217;ll be ignored.</p>

<blockquote><p>They don&#8217;t want to be sold something, they want to be talked to.</p></blockquote>

<p>You need to start engaging people, and that&#8217;s going to mean you have to give them a reason to like your page. Provide tips on gardening, show pictures of beautiful yards and offer to answer questions and help out with projects. Start Q&amp;A sessions that get people talking.  Make your page active and alive, and get more people to sign up and join. Use this is your great magnet and then direct them to your site when they&#8217;re ready to buy.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Reasons you should focus on Facebook (or Social Media in general).</h3>

<p>There are a few quick reasons why you should focus on your Facebook page. It&#8217;s the easiest way to build a following you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise reach.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> They are already there. No signing up for accounts, giving out an email address or anything. Easy as can be.</p></li>
<li><p> People sign on to Facebook every day. They would never go to your site daily but you can still reach them every time they&#8217;re on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p> There is a level of trust already established with Facebook. If you were bad they wouldn&#8217;t let you be there.</p></li>
<li><p> It&#8217;s easier for them to share things with their friends, who are also already on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p> Others can see you interacting with customers. Provide good customer service and everyone sees it.</p></li>
<li><p> Take advantage of herd theory - people tend to go where everyone else is going.</p></li>
<li><p> People can interact with you via their smartphone.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3></h3>

<p>This goes for Twitter as well. Twitter users are on it all day every day and your message is just a quick tweet away.  This is a great way to attract new fans to your site. Like the iPad in the living room the people are already there, and it takes very little commitment. Web forums and messageboards are dying. The ones that exist now will be the last standing and they&#8217;ll die off too (or switch you to Facebook logins)  so forget about that noise. Even comment systems are going to Disqus or Facebook comments, the simple fact is it&#8217;s harder every day to get someone to sign up for your website and participate.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Instead of thinking of your site as the hub of your efforts you should shift your focus to social media for a while. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should neglect your site or build a crappy one, it&#8217;s just that your focus should be on interacting with people. Utilize your captive audience that shows up every day. Get them interested in your product and let everyone see them interested. Then funnel them into your website when they&#8217;re ready to buy or want more information. You start to build the relationship long before you ask them to give you their information.</p>

<p>I have run several tests on this over the last year and found it to be true - this is the new marketing. Forget SEO and buying links, start talking to people who are already there, and already at the party. What&#8217;s more difficult: getting people to go to your website every day, or getting people to go to Facebook everyday?</p>

<p>Good luck, and start rethinking.</p>

<time datetime="2012-04-20T02:47:30+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 20<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The web has had a problem since the early days that&#8217;s just starting to get solved now. People want to talk back and they want to be heard. They also like joining communities and participating them, especially now. In the last ten years it&#8217;s possible for the average person to have created hundreds, if not thousands of separate accounts on different websites. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to just have one or two accounts to use everywhere?</p>

<h3><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/disqus.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/disqus.jpg" alt="disqus comments" /></a>What Disqus has done</h3>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen Disqus around, you will. It&#8217;s spreading to sites all over the place, and as of today I installed it on this one. What Discus has done is create a sort of single sign on for websites. You can make a comment on this site if you have an account on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Google (Gmail)</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Who doesn&#8217;t have at least one of those? In the past people had to create accounts everywhere, and the simple fact is nobody wants to do that. <strong>People have to really love your site, and be very compelled to discuss things with others, to create an account on it.</strong></p>

<p>Nobody wants to remember 1000 accounts, and people don&#8217;t want to give their email address to every site in the world, especially if they just want to make a comment and leave.</p>

<p>Discus has now connected them so you can log in to many websites with accounts you already use. This is so incredibly convenient and simple it&#8217;s amazing it wasn&#8217;t done years ago.</p>

<h3>How Disqus changes things:</h3>

<p>If this service takes off the web is going to be a different, better place. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p><strong>1. More people will participate</strong></p>

<p>Because they already have an account at one of these services, it it could be seconds to log in and make a comment. Once someone has decided to do this, they&#8217;re logged in whenever they visit another site with Disqus comments too. The people who have something to say but would never dream of creating an account on your blog (or don&#8217;t know how) will gladly post a comment if it&#8217;s made really easy. You&#8217;re rolling out the welcome mat for everyone and inviting them to your site.</p>

<p><strong>2. People will be nicer </strong></p>

<p>****If people commenting have some accountability the chances of them acting foolish diminishes greatly. Think about it, if you have a &#8220;badboy69&#8221; profile with fake info and a picture of a middle finger you can pretty much say anything you want and act inappropriately without it affecting you much in real life. You would say and do things you wouldn&#8217;t really do offline. But if your comments are tied to your REAL name, photo, school, employer, friends etc are you really going to act out of line? It acts as sort of a jerk filter on your site and someone could create a fake profile on Facebook and comment but the amount of people willing to do that are reduced. I think you&#8217;ll see more rational, respectable comments.</p>

<p><strong>3. You&#8217;ll have people seeking reputation</strong></p>

<p>****This ties into #2 slightly in that people will be more conscious of their image and reputation as they are posting. When all of my posts say &#8220;Jeremy Morgan&#8221; and have my smiling mug next to them you can bet I&#8217;m going to think about my reputation more. Do I want to post this? Is it helpful? Am I contributing positively here or just making a mess? These are things people think about more when their reputation is on the line. When people care about things like this they tend to make better decisions and contributions when posting something. You will get people willing to jump in and help.</p>

<p><strong>4. You will take advantage of herd theory
</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>Surely by now you&#8217;ve figured out the great forum/discussion problem as a webmaster. Nobody will comment on your stuff if nobody is commenting. Nobody is going to sign up for a forum if there is nobody on the forum, it&#8217;s an endless cycle that&#8217;s very hard to break out of. When it&#8217;s made this easy more people will comment. When more people comment, others see that and decide to jump in too. Soon people are spreading the links and talking about your site. More people on your site will lead to bigger improvement to said sites. <strong>By actively promoting engagement websites can improve and evolve for the better.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. It will reduce spam</strong></p>

<p>This one is one of the best benefits yet. Twenty dollar automated bots can create accounts and spam WordPress sites with ease. Every time I log into my panel I see another 100 or so comments left by spammers. They can do this with Disqus too, it&#8217;s just more difficult. Not only do they have to create an account on Facebook / Gmail / Twitter but they also have to take an extra step of connecting through Disqus as well before commenting. Also it doesn&#8217;t appear that links posted in Disqus comments can pass any link juice (though I don&#8217;t know that for sure) so that would eliminate some motivation to spam. ( Spammers don&#8217;t post links on forums for the traffic, they&#8217;re usually doing it for the backlinks to game search engines).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So after consideration I think that if Disqus takes off, we all win. From what I can see it&#8217;s being adopted all over the place and I hope this trend continues. It&#8217;s nice to have one login you can carry around with you and use everywhere and I&#8217;m sorry but OpenID is not easy enough for the average web surfer. I really hope this site takes off, if you have commenting on your site you should really consider it. You can even migrate all your old posts to it.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus website</a></p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/">Disqus for WordPress</a> (or you can just add it through plugins)</p>

<p>Have fun and leave a comment!</p>

<p>_ Note: This is not a paid endorsement of this service. I have not been paid or compensated in any way, and have had no contact with Disqus before doing this article. This is 100% my opinion only and I want to disclose that here._</p>

<time datetime="2012-04-18T00:03:27+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 18<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now you&#8217;ve likely seen the short film by Nirvan Mullick titled &#8220;Caine&#8217;s Arcade&#8221; about 9 year old Caine Monroy and the arcade he created from cardboard boxes in his dad&#8217;s parts store, as it has went globally viral in the last week. So what can we as Internet Marketers learn from this kid? A lot.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the video, <a href="http://www.cainesarcade.com/">watch it here</a>. It&#8217;s the best 10 minutes you&#8217;ll spend online all year. The story is very simple: a boy hanging out with his dad at work gets bored and starts creating an arcade, and immerses himself in it. Nobody shows up to the arcade and he has a hard time talking people into playing. One day Nirvan, a Los Angeles filmmaker who appears to know media pretty well, shows up to buy a part for his car and sees this elaborate arcade, and decides to play. Then comes the moment that will change both of their lives.</p>

<p>As Internet Marketers we should all be paying attention very closely here. Here are a few things we can learn from Caine and his story:</p>

<h3>1. Never Give Up</h3>

<p>This one is fairly obvious, but is a huge part of this story. At first, nobody was showing up at this kid&#8217;s arcade. He was begging people to come play and was being ignored. Did he quit? Of course not, he kept building and adding on to it. He acted as if he had hundreds of customers to answer to and kept plugging away at it, adding and changing, even though nobody was there. This kid figured out a secret to success that many adults have yet to grasp. He simply refused to give up and take the easy way out.</p>

<h3>2. Put yourself in the customer&#8217;s shoes</h3>

<p>One thing I noticed right away was this: Caine didn&#8217;t talk about how much money he wanted to make. He talked about the differences between plays and fun pass, but he didn&#8217;t focus on money or treat it as a goal. He focused on bringing people entertainment and fun. He played the games, improved them and thought about them. Rather than obsess over the money he wanted to make he obsessed over his product. He thought of the customer before anything else and really imagined what they wanted. He&#8217;s a younger Steve Jobs, obsessing over every tiny detail of the customer experience.</p>

<h3>3. Act as if you&#8217;re already successful.</h3>

<p>The one thing I noticed was before the flash mob incident Caine was being interviewed about the arcade, and talking about what people playing would say or think. The reality at the time was: there were no people. Caine had it set in his mind that people were going to show up, and worked and innovated as if his arcade were full of customers already. He designed games as if there were a line of people waiting outside to see what he was going to do next (there wasn&#8217;t). Yet he didn&#8217;t care, he trudged on and kept working on his product</p>

<p>When the crowds showed up, he was ready.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade.jpg" title="What we can learn from Caine's arcade" ></p>

<h3>4. Don&#8217;t worry about what others may think.</h3>

<p>Many kids his age would love to do something like this, but most would be afraid to. I&#8217;ll freely admit that at nine years old I wouldn&#8217;t have done something like this out of a fear of rejection, or being made fun of for it. Caine didn&#8217;t care, no matter what people thought of what he was doing, he continued on doing what he knew was right. If there were detractors he wasn&#8217;t deterred by them.</p>

<h3>5. Hard work still pays off.</h3>

<p>Did you notice the part where his father asks if he wants to go home for the day, as they are coming back from the pizza parlor? Without pause Caine says &#8220;no can do&#8221;. He&#8217;s determined to get back to work on his passion. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to see. Couple that with the fact that this kid spent months working and building this thing and waiting for people to show up. That&#8217;s an attention span you just don&#8217;t see anymore.</p>

<h3>6. It&#8217;s not about getting rich</h3>

<p>When you&#8217;re passionate about what you do, money is not the primary goal. When you hear Caine talk about the fun pass you get it: he&#8217;s trying to hook you in. He&#8217;s trying to entertain you. It&#8217;s not about getting $2 instead of $1 its about getting people to try his games and be entertained. When you see the smile on his face as he&#8217;s running things you quickly realize this isn&#8217;t about the money it&#8217;s about passion. Who cares if you get rich when you&#8217;re doing what you love?</p>

<h3>7. Don&#8217;t talk about what you are going to do, just do it.</h3>

<p>This kid could have sat around staring at the floor and wishing he would have an arcade someday. He could have told his friends &#8220;when I grow up&#8230;.&#8221; but he just couldn&#8217;t wait that long. Instead he took a leap and just started DOING what needed to be done. This kind of fearless bold attitude is what separates the talkers from the doers. Caine is obviously a doer.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade-2.jpg"></p>

<h3>8. Innovation is essential (and sometimes free).</h3>

<p>Caine showed a lot of innovation in his work. He saw that the soccer game was too easy so he changed it to make it harder. He wanted a claw machine so he made one. He created a checksum to validate a fun pass (pure genius by the way) and mostly used his imagination to improve his product. It cost him nothing more than imagination and time.</p>

<h3>9. Utilize what you have.</h3>

<p>The materials to make Caine&#8217;s games were boxes from his dad&#8217;s store and other items he found around there, and some of his prizes were his old toys. He took inventory of what he wanted to do, and what he had available to him and made them meet in the middle. Rather than wait for things to happen, he made them happen with what he had.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade-3.jpg"></p>

<h3>10. Make no excuses.</h3>

<p>This kid wouldn&#8217;t have to look far to find reasons to quit. He didn&#8217;t have even a single arcade game at his disposal, had very few tools and little budget. He&#8217;s just a 9 year old kid from East L.A. who doesn&#8217;t appear to come from a rich family (though it appears his father has given him something far more valuable than money) and nobody would question him for a second about giving up. But as we know that wasn&#8217;t really an option for him. Rather than find the reasons he couldn&#8217;t do something he found ways to do it. Instead of complaining and blaming everyone else for his problems he buckled down and made it happen. Even when nobody showed up he still kept going as if it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps&#8221; was made for people like Caine.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much you can learn from 10 minutes of video, and how much you can be inspired by a 9 year old boy with a dream. Caine has earned fame, appearances and a six figure college fund. He deserves every single bit of it. He showed heart and passion you don&#8217;t often see in children or even adults these days. He had a vision and worked to make it happen. He&#8217;s got a very bright future ahead of him.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The inspiration for this article started with a discussion I was having about successful blogs and websites.  From that I started thinking, and composed a tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Want to succeed? Don&#8217;t kiss ass, get walked on, hold your tongue or follow the crowd. Disrupt. Offend. Stand Out. Achieve.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got to thinking: this really is the silver bullet for a successful blog. In fact, it&#8217;s a secret to success in general. Nobody ever made a difference by following the crowd and doing what everyone was doing. So why do so many people follow this plan when they start a blog?</p>

<p>If you really want your site to take off, you have to stand out.  You have to have opinions and be ready to share them. You have to rock the boat, shake the cage and really put yourself up for scrutiny. You need to interact with people and be honest with them. Instead of worrying what everyone else is going to think, focus on what YOU think and why.</p>

<p>This is the real secret of success for the web, when it comes down to the brass tacks.</p>

<p>Some other things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give people content they want.  Ask, then listen.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to disagree with someone, even an industry expert.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid of offending people with your opinion.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to take an unpopular stance.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to be the first to try something.</li>
<li>Interact with others in the field.</li>
<li>Instead of fawning over celebrities and experts online, challenge them with good questions.</li>
<li>Keep your eye on your prize.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you try to build something that everyone likes you&#8217;ll fail.  Don&#8217;t worry about anyone else, just create. Let your personality shine through and do what you want to do. The more you enjoy it the better you&#8217;ll do at it.</p>

<p>Stop making excuses, get out there and do it.</p>
