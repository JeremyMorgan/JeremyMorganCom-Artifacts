      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you got yourself a new website set up and you want to be at the bottom of the &#8220;shower head&#8221; search results. This may not get you banned altogether, but it will at least get your site deranked enough that new visitors will stop bothering you.</p>

<h3>1. Build hundreds of pages with the same content.</h3>

<p>Build as many pages as you can, with basically the same content. Build one for &#8220;shower heads in Oregon&#8221;, then build another for &#8220;shower heads in California&#8221;. Build one for every state, and all the big cities in that state. Doing this should get your site banned in a month or two if you do it right.</p>

<h3>2. Buy 145 domains, and point them all at the same site.</h3>

<p>Another old SEO trick that works well. Since you are selling shower heads, you should get:</p>

<p>shower-heads.com</p>

<p>buy-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>where-to-buy-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>where-to-find-free-shower-heads.com</p>

<p>You get the idea. Build up enough of these and submit them all to google and yahoo, so they can index them and properly punish your site.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Keep your keyword density as high as possible. </strong></h3>

<p>Who cares what the text sounds like, keep it optimized. Here is an example of BAD text:</p>

<p>_&#8221;At Jeremy&#8217;s Shower heads, we have many name brand shower heads to choose from, and you can order online&#8221;. _</p>

<p>That almost sounds like something a human would say. Try this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;At Jeremy&#8217;s Shower Heads, we have the most shower heads out of any shower heads manufacturer, or shower heads dealer. Come check out our shower heads store and look at all our shower heads and shower heads supplies we have available. Need more shower heads, or a special shower head? We can special order shower heads too.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Not only do you have more text, but we have 15.5% keyword density for &#8220;shower heads&#8221;. That should be enough to trip the spam filter in most major engines. If it doesnt, try adding &#8220;shower heads&#8221; into random spots in the paragraph.</p>

<h3>4. Spam your links in wordpress or other blog comments.</h3>

<p>Nothing says &#8220;crappy spam site&#8221; more, and if you do this enough, the search engines will notice. Since very few people probably click those links anyway, you wont have any new visitors bothering you either.</p>

<h3>5. Join as many link exchanges as possible.</h3>

<p>Try to get as many link exchanges going, with as many sites as possible. If you run a shower head site, trading links with a quilting directory makes perfect sense. Enough irrelevant links, and you should see a good drop in rankings you should actually get naturally.</p>

<h3>6. Use as many free for all &#8220;FFA&#8221; sites as possible.</h3>

<p>Same theory, link exchanges with irrelevant sites won&#8217;t get you banned, but they will certainly drop your rankings.</p>

<h3>7. Target popular keywords and enjoy the extra traffic.</h3>

<p>Dont fill your site with keywords about shower heads. Throw in paris hilton, britney spears, and mortage rates. With all those extra people coming in, you&#8217;re bound to sell a shower head or two. Targeted marketing is for people who want to be bothered by customers all the time.</p>

<h3>8. Generate random text</h3>

<p>The more text, the better. Generating random text is a great way to get new people into your site, but dont worry they&#8217;ll close the browser once they read the gibberish. And google will punish your rankings also.</p>

<h3>9. Build cloak pages!</h3>

<p>A cloaked page is a page designed to be seen by search engines, and optimized, then a real user sees an entirely different page. Again, all the people coming to your super britney spears page listed on google, will surely be happy that you have such a wide selection of shower heads. And soon google will catch on to your cloaked pages also.</p>

<h3>10. Hide your text</h3>

<p>This one is awesome! There is no way the search engines will ever figure out your white text on a white background. This secret text is your key to getting banned, and rather quickly if someone finds it and tattles on you. So get that huge keyword list ready and start loading up the page!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I hope this has helped. The sarcasm even got old to me by the end of the list, but these are things you should never, ever consider on your site. Many of the tactics haven&#8217;t worked well for years, and many of them are futile anyway, as you&#8217;re only getting traffic that isn&#8217;t interested in your product. Keep these in mind when talking to an SEO also.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every month, thousands of dollars are being thrown at junk SEOs. Have you been approached by an SEO yet? How do you know whether they are good or bad? How do you know whether they are a scammer or the real deal? Here are some basic things to look for when dealing with an SEO:</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t fall for &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; listings. </strong></p>

<p>I never guarantee listings. No reputable SEO will. I know this sounds silly, but let me explain.  We don&#8217;t own google, Yahoo or MSN. So how can we possibly guarantee anything? There are thousands or more competing for your exact search term. And there are thousands of variables that affect your ranking. No SEO can guarantee anything. Sure, they can guarantee positive movement, or better exposure, but nobody can guarantee you a ranking. (This does not apply to SEM / PPC optimization of course).</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t do link building schemes.</strong></p>

<p>When an SEO tells you they can get you valuable incoming links, they aren&#8217;t lying. Many SEO companies have a large set of sites that are built into a link network. And indeed, they can raise your ranking by linking in to you. So why is this bad? Because search engines, especially google, are getting better every day at detecting them and you could end up penalizing yourself. SE&#8217;s consider this link manipulation, and artificially inflating the rank of the site. Earlier this year, and most recently, google shifted their algorithm to reduce the rank of sites who buy or sell  &#8220;PR links&#8221;.</p>

<p>A good SEO  will certainly try to get you more inbound links. It&#8217;s a crucial part of SEO. But they need to be &#8220;natural&#8221; inbounds. When I work with clients, I encourage them to create content people actually want to link to, give them avenues for promotion, and let other webmasters do the rest. If your site is good, people will link to it. And thats exactly why google values inbound links so much, they want a democratic system of finding good sites. So ask about that.</p>

<p><strong>Dont pay for resubmission.</strong></p>

<p>Some say you shouldn&#8217;t pay an ongoing fee for SEO at all. I disagree with this. However, you do want to ask exactly what it is you&#8217;re paying for. When I do maintenance, I ensure that all new pages are in the sitemap, and track their indexing status, and I check ranks to spot trends, and examine traffic analytics. I make suggestions, changes, add content, and services like that, and I tell the customer exactly what they&#8217;re getting. If you are paying some schlep to &#8220;resubmit their site to search engines&#8221; then stop today. No amount of submitting is going to raise your rankings, and as google has said many times, you only need to submit once.</p>

<p><strong>Dont fall for &#8220;tricks&#8221;.</strong></p>

<p>This one is self explanatory. If an SEO approaches you with a set of &#8220;tricks&#8221; to get your site to the top, beware. While these &#8220;tricks&#8221; might be effective, they can get you banned as well. You have to measure risk vs. reward, something every business owner does daily. Do you want that extra 1000 hits to be the last ones the search engine sends you? Ask questions, and do research. Black Hat SEO is effective, but its not good for a long term business plan, or sites that want to be around for a while. Most Black Hats use disposable domains and discard them once banned.</p>

<p><strong>Ask them what they are doing. </strong></p>

<p>Anytime someone provides a service, you should know what they&#8217;re getting. And if you are going to hand over the keys to your site, you better have some idea what they&#8217;re doing in there. If an SEO tells you its &#8220;secret&#8221; and he cannot divulge what he&#8217;s doing, skip him/her altogether. Offer to sign an NDA, and if they still won&#8217;t tell you, dont buy.</p>

<p><strong>Research.  </strong></p>

<p>Again, basic business sense. If an SEO approaches you with a sales pitch, by all means give them a shot, especially if you are interested. There are a lot of really good SEOs out there who are legitimate and helpful. But don&#8217;t buy right away. Do some research, ask around and find out what their competitors charge, what they&#8217;re doing, and make sure they aren&#8217;t some scam group that ex customers have outed on the web. An ounce of prevention&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll touch more on some of these subjects later. But always be cautious, with any new industry you have people looking to take advantage of unsuspecting customers.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-12-14T12:32:48-08:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 14<span>th</span>, 2007</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some very basic things that ANY site should do, regardless of how aggressive your marketing is, or what your strategy is. Maybe you&#8217;re doing all of these things already, but most sites don&#8217;t. Here we go:</p>

<p><strong> 1. Make a site map.</strong></p>

<p>This one sounds fairly obvious, but how many sites honestly have them? Your site should contain an XML site map for Google and Yahoo, as well as a &#8220;browser view&#8221; site map for humans. Aside from the search engine value, a site map is a great navigation asset for your visitors as well. I find myself frequently hitting a site map to quickly find something.</p>

<p><strong>2. Clean up your HTML. </strong></p>

<p>This one is pretty simple. Just because it looks good to us, doesn&#8217;t mean it looks good to googlebot.  Clean html will ensure that spiders get your content, and crawl your entire site properly. I should emphasize,  however that focusing too hard on how the bot views your page should never compromise what the viewer sees. After all, humans are still the target.</p>

<p><strong>3.  Vary your title tags and keyword them. </strong></p>

<p>Title tags will not make or break you, like they did a few years ago. But the fact is, if you have 30 pages on your site, all with the same title tag, you&#8217;re doing yourself a disservice.  Make sure they are all different, and reflect what&#8217;s on the page. For instance &#8220;ACME Inc - Contact us&#8221; on your contact page is much better than just Acme Inc on every page.</p>

<p><strong>4. Keywords!</strong></p>

<p>Like title tags, keyword density will no longer make you, but it may break you. Not enough keyword density does not equal complete failure. But too much keyword density will. Remember that part of Google&#8217;s algorithms involve natural speech patterns, and detection for spam. If you are using the same keyword 15% of the time in your article, it&#8217;s not natural speech. A good rule of thumb:  Would you read your site&#8217;s copy out loud in front a group? If you would feel  silly doing so, then why are you putting it on your website?</p>

<p><strong>5. Proper Semantics. </strong></p>

<p>How does your site flow? How are your headings? As a general rule, you should have 1 <h1> tag that outlines the primary purpose of the page. Then use <h2> and <h3> tags accordingly for subheadings. I&#8217;ll touch more on this later. For more reading on this, check out <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/essentials-modern-web-design">this article</a>.</p>

<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t buy or sell links. </strong></p>

<p>This is a hot topic right now. The last algorithm change ostensibly de-ranked sites that buy and sell links. Why would they care? You might ask. The answer is, its seen as manipulating rankings. Google does not want to rank the site that can afford to buy the most links, they want to rank the best sites. Critics say it&#8217;s because they want to push adwords more. There may be truth in that also, but either way don&#8217;t expect this rule to go away anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>7. Keep your content unique </strong></p>

<p>This is fairly self explanatory. This also applies to web marketing in general, if you&#8217;re offering a commodity product, you can&#8217;t expect demand to be the same as it is for unique sites. Keep it as fresh and unique as possible.</p>

<p><strong>8. Update Often.</strong></p>

<p>Again, fairly simple concept. Update often. That&#8217;s the rule. Even if you choose not to have a blog on your site, upload photos, create event pages, special deals, etc. The more often a page is updated, the better it will rank in google. Stale sites tend to slip down to the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>9. Keyword rich URLs and file names.  </strong></p>

<p>This may seem spammy at first, but as long as you don&#8217;t abuse it, it&#8217;s a good tactic. Name your page contact-acme.htm instead of just contact. Or even how-to-contact-acme.htm isn&#8217;t too much of a stretch. The customer rarely notices. Don&#8217;t go too crazy with this (ie. free-pictures-of-britney-spears-with-no-top-on.htm) because not only does it look tacky, it may raise flags.</p>

<p><strong>10. Submit!  </strong></p>

<p>Submit your site everywhere! Technorati, delicious, digg, and other social bookmarking sites will bring in fresh new traffic. But also submit it to niche-specific directories if possible. You&#8217;d be surprised how many &#8220;sheetrock installer usa&#8221; type directories exist out there. This brings in new traffic, and creates inbound links.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the article. More to come later!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first time I&#8217;d heard of any kind of search engine optimization, it wasn&#8217;t even called that. It was the late 90s, and I was a web developer, reading an article about meta tags.  I thought to myself, people will likely abuse it, but the payoff wouldn&#8217;t be great.</p>

<p>You see, at that time there was no Google, and yahoo! was a big dog, but I foolishly ignored search engines as a form of traffic. I would submit my client sites to yahoo, but most of the time spent marketing focused on link exchanges and things of that sort. For some of my clients, I even went on to Usenet and answered important questions, with a url in a signature (a methodology that&#8217;s still effective by the way).  Those were the good old days.</p>

<p>By the time I got in to SEO seriously, in the early 2000s, meta tags were a thing of the past. The game had changed. Now it was about keywords and H1s, and title tag. Does anyone remember how back in 2003 you could put something in the title tag, bust out an H1 and some alt tags, and get a top ranking? Those were the days.</p>

<p>Enough reminiscing. Now that we&#8217;re fresh out of yet another dramatic algorithm update by Google, we have to ask ourselves what&#8217;s next? The answer to that is simple. Real content.</p>

<p>Real Content has been the key to good SEO all along. It&#8217;s no secret sites with great content get return visitors, and happy customers. Well, guess what the search engines want?  The same thing. They want happy customers, and relevant results. Content is king! This is the infallible rule of the web, nearly since day one. Content, content and more content. YOUR content. Good content. This is what real SEO consists of.</p>

<p>The web is becoming increasingly social, and the search engines are aware of it. They&#8217;re  looking for sites that people actually like, so you can&#8217;t put lipstick on a pig anymore. Spammy overoptimized sites fall off the search engines daily. If you are an SEO, your goal should not be manipulating rankings with tricks or gimmicks. You should be doing everything possible to make sure the engines list you, sure. Proper code, semantics, tags, site maps. The technical part is still relevant. But you should be doing all of these things to ensure your CONTENT is being focused.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll come back and go into more detail about this later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of all the things that come and go in the web development world, it&#8217;s hard to tell what will stay, and what will go. Frames, animated gifs, and scrolling status boxes were once all the rage, but have went the way of parachute pants while other things like rounded corners stick around. So naturally you might be asking yourself, &#8220;should I go the table less route?&#8221;</p>

<p>I hate to sound like a coding snob, but by now you should be in your 3rd or 4th year of developing CSS layouts. Yet as I browse around the net, I see many brand new sites popping up all the time with tables. I suppose it is easier (especially if you use a wysiwyg editor) and faster to do things the old way. Even I was reluctant to change at first. But CSS layouts aren&#8217;t just another fad, they&#8217;re here to stay. And here is why.</p>

<p><strong>Separating Content from Design</strong></p>

<p>As web development has evolved, we&#8217;ve had to change the way we do things drastically many times. Remember when you used font tags? I can remember going wild with them, having a blast poring through hundreds of lines of html and doing long find and replace functions when making font changes. Then came CSS, and it was like a whole new world had opened up for us. You could suddenly change a font on every single page of your site from one line in one file. This was the beginning of the separation paradigm.</p>

<p>HTML is no longer used for formatting, and rightly so. HTML was originally designed as a markup language for sharing documents and research papers online. Early text-only browsers interpreted data and produced hyperlinks. When the mainstream usage of the web came along, graphic designers wanted to make pages look alive, and bring colors and images to the web. They used tables and spacer images to create layouts, and that worked for a while.</p>

<p>But soon, as tables become nested within nested tables, you had a considerable mess of code on your hands. Not to mention the extra bandwidth and loading time associated with complex tables. Maintaining these sites became a nightmare.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, CSS was beginning to take hold with developers, and soon enough coders started using CSS to modify div elements as opposed to tables. During this early period browser support could be somewhat tricky, but hacks were quickly introduced.</p>

<p>Around 2006, tableless design really started to become a topic of discussion. Browser maturity eased some of the problems faced earlier, and it became much easier to put together full layouts with just CSS. This eliminated the problems associated with tables.</p>

<p>Now we have an html document that holds the data, and CSS to present it.</p>

<p><strong>Maintainability</strong></p>

<p>Code that is maintainable is important to any organization. This does not just cover &#8220;real&#8221; code like php or asp. Html can also easily turn into a giant mess that&#8217;s difficult to work with. By using CSS layouts the HTML doesn&#8217;t have to undergo nearly as much changes when redesigning or modifying (In fact, you can completely redesign your whole site just by working with the CSS). Not to mention when you have boatloads of table code and font tags in your html, going in for a quick change can be time consuming. With tableless layouts you&#8217;ll see much less html in the source files. Which brings us to our next reason.</p>

<p><strong>Bandwidth</strong></p>

<p>More html equals more bandwidth. All those redundant tags, the nested tables, etc can really add up quick. They can slow your browser down as well, when it&#8217;s choking to assemble a page with a million
tags all over. This can really improve your load times by converting.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>

<p>With the multitude of broswers out there, it&#8217;s tough to keep up with all of them. Remember the days when pages in netscape looked completely different from IE? When you rely on html to present your page, you&#8217;re trusting that every browser will display things the same way. This of course is not usually the case. Not to mention once your page loads on to a mobile phone, who knows what you are going to get. What if a blind person accesses your page? These are are other things to consider. Websites that use CSS for presentation are generally more compatible with the browsers out in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>CSS is here to stay!</strong></p>

<p>If you are still using tables, it&#8217;s a great to time to stop. Start learning now how to build layouts using CSS now, because you&#8217;ll find a lot more sites out there designed this way in the future. As your customers bring you websites they want work done on, more and more of them will have CSS layouts. If you get a job as a developer for a company you&#8217;ll run into more CSS layouts. And if you want a job at a web design firm, you&#8217;re not going to be hired if insist on using tables.</p>

<p>So if you want maintainable, fast loading pages, that are easy to modify and look good on multiple browsers, it&#8217;s a good time to change. This is one &#8220;fad&#8221; that is here to stay, and I&#8217;m glad for it.</p>
