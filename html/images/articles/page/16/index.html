  <div class="entry-content"><p>A NYC Taxi driver wrote:</p>

<p>I arrived at the address and honked the horn. After waiting a few minutes I honked again. Since this was going to be my last ride of my shift I thought about just driving away, but instead I put the car in park and walked up to the door and knocked.. &#8220;Just a minute&#8221;, answered a frail, elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.jeremymorgan.com/a-sweet-lesson-in-patience.jpg" title="A sweet lesson in patience" ></p>

<p>After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90s stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie.</p>

<p>By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.</p>

<p>There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you carry my bag out to the car?&#8221; she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman.</p>

<p>She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.</p>

<p>She kept thanking me for my kindness. &#8220;It&#8221;s nothing&#8221;, I told her.. &#8220;I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother to be treated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re such a good boy, she said. When we got in the cab, she gave me an address and then asked, &#8220;Could you drive through downtown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the shortest way,&#8221; I answered quickly..</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in no hurry. I&#8217;m on my way to a hospice&#8221;.</p>

<p>I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any family left,&#8221; she continued in a soft voice..&#8221;The doctor says I don&#8217;t have very long.&#8221; I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What route would you like me to take?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>For the next two hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.</p>

<p>We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes she&#8217;d ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.</p>

<p>As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired.Let&#8217;s go now&#8221;. We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.</p>

<p>Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move.</p>

<p>They must have been expecting her.</p>

<p>I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do I owe you?&#8221; She asked, reaching into her purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to make a living,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other passengers,&#8221; I responded.</p>

<p>Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug.She held onto me tightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light.. Behind me, a door shut.It was the sound of the closing of a life..</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of that day,I could hardly talk.What if that woman had gotten an angry driver,or one who was impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away?</p>

<p>On a quick review, I don&#8221;t think that I have done anything more important in my life.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.</p>

<p>But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What I&#8217;m going to say here flies in the face of much of what I have been posting here the last few years. It may not be what you want to hear, but it&#8217;s the truth. Most people don&#8217;t care about your website and you might be wasting your time working on it, but there&#8217;s something you can do about it.</p>

<h3>The Main Idea</h3>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-24.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-24.jpg" alt="Cocktail Party" /></a></p>

<p>Imagine you&#8217;re at a party with a couple hundred attendees at a nice house. You know people at the party, but there are a lot of strangers as well and everyone seems to be having a good time.</p>

<p>You just bought a new exotic car that you just want to show off, you know your friends are going to love it. You even want to show it to some strangers too, maybe make some new cruising buddies. How will you get the most attention possible?</p>

<p>There are a few ways you could do it, with varying results.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Leave the car at your house and invite people to come over and see it.</strong></p>

<p>If you choose this option a  few might decide to leave the party and come check it out. This would most likely be either your loyal friends and people really interested in the car. You might gather up a handful of people to go with you, but it would be a fraction of the overall attendees. It&#8217;s not that your car isn&#8217;t awesome, it&#8217;s just that people are already at a party having a good time, so why would they want to leave?</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Drive the car to the party and invite people to come outside to see it. </strong></p>

<p>This method would be much more effective largely because it&#8217;s more convenient for them; all they really have to do is go outside and take a look. It requires a small commitment and it&#8217;s easy to back out of, if your car sucks they can just go back inside to the party. This method would get far more people than the road trip to your house.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3: Set up some interactive cameras in your garage and pipe the feed to your iPad.</strong></p>

<p>Now you&#8217;ve got the home run idea. You break out the ipad and start showing off the system to your friends. Your friends are enthralled by every angle of your beautiful Italian masterpiece of a car as you play a couple videos of it driving and show some specs on it.  People start to crowd around you to see what everyone is looking at.</p>

<p>Not only are you showing off your car, but using a neat gimmick to do so. You&#8217;re giving people all the information you could give them from your garage, yet they never had to even leave the room. Commitment consists of peering over at an ipad, they don&#8217;t even have to set their drink down.  People see other people looking at it and they get curious too, next thing you know you&#8217;ve met tons of people more interested in your car.</p>

<p>Not only did you show off your car to a bunch of people, but you&#8217;ve actually added to the fun of this party.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t caught the parallels yet, your website is the car, and the party is Facebook.  Social Media is the party everyone is at, do you want to keep trying to drag everyone to your house? Nobody cares about your website until you&#8217;ve pulled them in.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Who Visits Your Website Now?</h3>

<p>If you&#8217;re like most websites most of your visitors will fall into one of these groups, especially if you&#8217;re running an eCommerce site.  Let&#8217;s use a site a Home and Garden store as an example and take a look at the type of customers they might have.</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-1.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nobody-cares-about-your-website-1.jpg" alt="Who Visits Your Website? " /></a></p>

<h3></h3>

<p><strong>Hardcore Visitors -</strong> These people check your site religiously looking for new products, deals and more. They love your site, they love your brand and company. They tell everyone they know about you and are often early adopters. They know what you have in your store better than you do.</p>

<p><strong>The Regulars -</strong> These are the folks who are constantly involved in projects and frequent your website to check prices and see what kind of specials you have.  Like the hardcore visitors they like your company and go to you first.</p>

<p><strong>Tire Kickers -  </strong>We all know the type, these folks are just looking at the pictures on your site and maybe sending you an email or calling you just to ask countless questions. They aren&#8217;t going to buy anything and they are most likely reading your website from 3000 miles away.</p>

<p><strong>Information Seekers - </strong>These are the people Google sends you, they&#8217;re looking for what you sell, how much are you selling it for and where are you located. What are your hours? This is some of the information they&#8217;re seeking and many of them will turn into customers if you give them what they want.</p>

<p>So you might be asking yourself, Jeremy why did you say nobody cares about my website then tell me about all the people who go to it? The answer is simple: out of all these people the amount you can truly engage with is very small. If you set up forums, how many people would sign up and start participating? How many would get their friends to join?</p>

<p>If you answered a fraction of a percent you&#8217;d be correct. In all my years of experience I&#8217;ve never seen more than about .3% of a site&#8217;s audience sign up for their forum or message board. This is because they simply don&#8217;t care enough. These people might be interested what you charge for a bag of barkdust, but they certainly aren&#8217;t going to sign up for your forums and visit your website every day. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s Facebook or something.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>So what do you do to get them to care?</h3>

<p>This one is pretty easy but requires you to change your outlook on your whole web strategy. Instead of thinking of your website as a hub that you need to draw people into, reverse it a little. You need to create a social media presence, especially on Facebook and Twitter, and start focusing on that first.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard me right, you need to focus on your social media presence and think of your site as a simple endpoint, or a &#8220;get more information area&#8221;. Your new strategy should be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a Page on Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Suggest it to all your friends</p></li>
<li><p>Put it on business cards and signs</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for Twitter and link it to Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Do daily or weekly updates to the page that get people engaged</p></li>
</ul>


<p>If you focus on your niche, you can come up with a lot of things to say on a Facebook page. You could talk about your barkdust prices but that&#8217;s just going to get people to ignore you. You could ask them to come into your store every day, and you&#8217;ll be ignored.</p>

<blockquote><p>They don&#8217;t want to be sold something, they want to be talked to.</p></blockquote>

<p>You need to start engaging people, and that&#8217;s going to mean you have to give them a reason to like your page. Provide tips on gardening, show pictures of beautiful yards and offer to answer questions and help out with projects. Start Q&amp;A sessions that get people talking.  Make your page active and alive, and get more people to sign up and join. Use this is your great magnet and then direct them to your site when they&#8217;re ready to buy.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Reasons you should focus on Facebook (or Social Media in general).</h3>

<p>There are a few quick reasons why you should focus on your Facebook page. It&#8217;s the easiest way to build a following you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise reach.</p>

<ol>
<li><p> They are already there. No signing up for accounts, giving out an email address or anything. Easy as can be.</p></li>
<li><p> People sign on to Facebook every day. They would never go to your site daily but you can still reach them every time they&#8217;re on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p> There is a level of trust already established with Facebook. If you were bad they wouldn&#8217;t let you be there.</p></li>
<li><p> It&#8217;s easier for them to share things with their friends, who are also already on Facebook.</p></li>
<li><p> Others can see you interacting with customers. Provide good customer service and everyone sees it.</p></li>
<li><p> Take advantage of herd theory - people tend to go where everyone else is going.</p></li>
<li><p> People can interact with you via their smartphone.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3></h3>

<p>This goes for Twitter as well. Twitter users are on it all day every day and your message is just a quick tweet away.  This is a great way to attract new fans to your site. Like the iPad in the living room the people are already there, and it takes very little commitment. Web forums and messageboards are dying. The ones that exist now will be the last standing and they&#8217;ll die off too (or switch you to Facebook logins)  so forget about that noise. Even comment systems are going to Disqus or Facebook comments, the simple fact is it&#8217;s harder every day to get someone to sign up for your website and participate.</p>

<h3></h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Instead of thinking of your site as the hub of your efforts you should shift your focus to social media for a while. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should neglect your site or build a crappy one, it&#8217;s just that your focus should be on interacting with people. Utilize your captive audience that shows up every day. Get them interested in your product and let everyone see them interested. Then funnel them into your website when they&#8217;re ready to buy or want more information. You start to build the relationship long before you ask them to give you their information.</p>

<p>I have run several tests on this over the last year and found it to be true - this is the new marketing. Forget SEO and buying links, start talking to people who are already there, and already at the party. What&#8217;s more difficult: getting people to go to your website every day, or getting people to go to Facebook everyday?</p>

<p>Good luck, and start rethinking.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The web has had a problem since the early days that&#8217;s just starting to get solved now. People want to talk back and they want to be heard. They also like joining communities and participating them, especially now. In the last ten years it&#8217;s possible for the average person to have created hundreds, if not thousands of separate accounts on different websites. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to just have one or two accounts to use everywhere?</p>

<h3><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/disqus.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/disqus.jpg" alt="disqus comments" /></a>What Disqus has done</h3>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen Disqus around, you will. It&#8217;s spreading to sites all over the place, and as of today I installed it on this one. What Discus has done is create a sort of single sign on for websites. You can make a comment on this site if you have an account on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Google (Gmail)</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Who doesn&#8217;t have at least one of those? In the past people had to create accounts everywhere, and the simple fact is nobody wants to do that. <strong>People have to really love your site, and be very compelled to discuss things with others, to create an account on it.</strong></p>

<p>Nobody wants to remember 1000 accounts, and people don&#8217;t want to give their email address to every site in the world, especially if they just want to make a comment and leave.</p>

<p>Discus has now connected them so you can log in to many websites with accounts you already use. This is so incredibly convenient and simple it&#8217;s amazing it wasn&#8217;t done years ago.</p>

<h3>How Disqus changes things:</h3>

<p>If this service takes off the web is going to be a different, better place. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<p><strong>1. More people will participate</strong></p>

<p>Because they already have an account at one of these services, it it could be seconds to log in and make a comment. Once someone has decided to do this, they&#8217;re logged in whenever they visit another site with Disqus comments too. The people who have something to say but would never dream of creating an account on your blog (or don&#8217;t know how) will gladly post a comment if it&#8217;s made really easy. You&#8217;re rolling out the welcome mat for everyone and inviting them to your site.</p>

<p><strong>2. People will be nicer </strong></p>

<p>****If people commenting have some accountability the chances of them acting foolish diminishes greatly. Think about it, if you have a &#8220;badboy69&#8221; profile with fake info and a picture of a middle finger you can pretty much say anything you want and act inappropriately without it affecting you much in real life. You would say and do things you wouldn&#8217;t really do offline. But if your comments are tied to your REAL name, photo, school, employer, friends etc are you really going to act out of line? It acts as sort of a jerk filter on your site and someone could create a fake profile on Facebook and comment but the amount of people willing to do that are reduced. I think you&#8217;ll see more rational, respectable comments.</p>

<p><strong>3. You&#8217;ll have people seeking reputation</strong></p>

<p>****This ties into #2 slightly in that people will be more conscious of their image and reputation as they are posting. When all of my posts say &#8220;Jeremy Morgan&#8221; and have my smiling mug next to them you can bet I&#8217;m going to think about my reputation more. Do I want to post this? Is it helpful? Am I contributing positively here or just making a mess? These are things people think about more when their reputation is on the line. When people care about things like this they tend to make better decisions and contributions when posting something. You will get people willing to jump in and help.</p>

<p><strong>4. You will take advantage of herd theory
</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong>Surely by now you&#8217;ve figured out the great forum/discussion problem as a webmaster. Nobody will comment on your stuff if nobody is commenting. Nobody is going to sign up for a forum if there is nobody on the forum, it&#8217;s an endless cycle that&#8217;s very hard to break out of. When it&#8217;s made this easy more people will comment. When more people comment, others see that and decide to jump in too. Soon people are spreading the links and talking about your site. More people on your site will lead to bigger improvement to said sites. <strong>By actively promoting engagement websites can improve and evolve for the better.</strong></p>

<p><strong>5. It will reduce spam</strong></p>

<p>This one is one of the best benefits yet. Twenty dollar automated bots can create accounts and spam WordPress sites with ease. Every time I log into my panel I see another 100 or so comments left by spammers. They can do this with Disqus too, it&#8217;s just more difficult. Not only do they have to create an account on Facebook / Gmail / Twitter but they also have to take an extra step of connecting through Disqus as well before commenting. Also it doesn&#8217;t appear that links posted in Disqus comments can pass any link juice (though I don&#8217;t know that for sure) so that would eliminate some motivation to spam. ( Spammers don&#8217;t post links on forums for the traffic, they&#8217;re usually doing it for the backlinks to game search engines).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So after consideration I think that if Disqus takes off, we all win. From what I can see it&#8217;s being adopted all over the place and I hope this trend continues. It&#8217;s nice to have one login you can carry around with you and use everywhere and I&#8217;m sorry but OpenID is not easy enough for the average web surfer. I really hope this site takes off, if you have commenting on your site you should really consider it. You can even migrate all your old posts to it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By now you&#8217;ve likely seen the short film by Nirvan Mullick titled &#8220;Caine&#8217;s Arcade&#8221; about 9 year old Caine Monroy and the arcade he created from cardboard boxes in his dad&#8217;s parts store, as it has went globally viral in the last week. So what can we as Internet Marketers learn from this kid? A lot.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen the video, <a href="http://www.cainesarcade.com/">watch it here</a>. It&#8217;s the best 10 minutes you&#8217;ll spend online all year. The story is very simple: a boy hanging out with his dad at work gets bored and starts creating an arcade, and immerses himself in it. Nobody shows up to the arcade and he has a hard time talking people into playing. One day Nirvan, a Los Angeles filmmaker who appears to know media pretty well, shows up to buy a part for his car and sees this elaborate arcade, and decides to play. Then comes the moment that will change both of their lives.</p>

<p>As Internet Marketers we should all be paying attention very closely here. Here are a few things we can learn from Caine and his story:</p>

<h3>1. Never Give Up</h3>

<p>This one is fairly obvious, but is a huge part of this story. At first, nobody was showing up at this kid&#8217;s arcade. He was begging people to come play and was being ignored. Did he quit? Of course not, he kept building and adding on to it. He acted as if he had hundreds of customers to answer to and kept plugging away at it, adding and changing, even though nobody was there. This kid figured out a secret to success that many adults have yet to grasp. He simply refused to give up and take the easy way out.</p>

<h3>2. Put yourself in the customer&#8217;s shoes</h3>

<p>One thing I noticed right away was this: Caine didn&#8217;t talk about how much money he wanted to make. He talked about the differences between plays and fun pass, but he didn&#8217;t focus on money or treat it as a goal. He focused on bringing people entertainment and fun. He played the games, improved them and thought about them. Rather than obsess over the money he wanted to make he obsessed over his product. He thought of the customer before anything else and really imagined what they wanted. He&#8217;s a younger Steve Jobs, obsessing over every tiny detail of the customer experience.</p>

<h3>3. Act as if you&#8217;re already successful.</h3>

<p>The one thing I noticed was before the flash mob incident Caine was being interviewed about the arcade, and talking about what people playing would say or think. The reality at the time was: there were no people. Caine had it set in his mind that people were going to show up, and worked and innovated as if his arcade were full of customers already. He designed games as if there were a line of people waiting outside to see what he was going to do next (there wasn&#8217;t). Yet he didn&#8217;t care, he trudged on and kept working on his product</p>

<p>When the crowds showed up, he was ready.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade.jpg" title="What we can learn from Caine's arcade" ></p>

<h3>4. Don&#8217;t worry about what others may think.</h3>

<p>Many kids his age would love to do something like this, but most would be afraid to. I&#8217;ll freely admit that at nine years old I wouldn&#8217;t have done something like this out of a fear of rejection, or being made fun of for it. Caine didn&#8217;t care, no matter what people thought of what he was doing, he continued on doing what he knew was right. If there were detractors he wasn&#8217;t deterred by them.</p>

<h3>5. Hard work still pays off.</h3>

<p>Did you notice the part where his father asks if he wants to go home for the day, as they are coming back from the pizza parlor? Without pause Caine says &#8220;no can do&#8221;. He&#8217;s determined to get back to work on his passion. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to see. Couple that with the fact that this kid spent months working and building this thing and waiting for people to show up. That&#8217;s an attention span you just don&#8217;t see anymore.</p>

<h3>6. It&#8217;s not about getting rich</h3>

<p>When you&#8217;re passionate about what you do, money is not the primary goal. When you hear Caine talk about the fun pass you get it: he&#8217;s trying to hook you in. He&#8217;s trying to entertain you. It&#8217;s not about getting $2 instead of $1 its about getting people to try his games and be entertained. When you see the smile on his face as he&#8217;s running things you quickly realize this isn&#8217;t about the money it&#8217;s about passion. Who cares if you get rich when you&#8217;re doing what you love?</p>

<h3>7. Don&#8217;t talk about what you are going to do, just do it.</h3>

<p>This kid could have sat around staring at the floor and wishing he would have an arcade someday. He could have told his friends &#8220;when I grow up&#8230;.&#8221; but he just couldn&#8217;t wait that long. Instead he took a leap and just started DOING what needed to be done. This kind of fearless bold attitude is what separates the talkers from the doers. Caine is obviously a doer.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade-2.jpg"></p>

<h3>8. Innovation is essential (and sometimes free).</h3>

<p>Caine showed a lot of innovation in his work. He saw that the soccer game was too easy so he changed it to make it harder. He wanted a claw machine so he made one. He created a checksum to validate a fun pass (pure genius by the way) and mostly used his imagination to improve his product. It cost him nothing more than imagination and time.</p>

<h3>9. Utilize what you have.</h3>

<p>The materials to make Caine&#8217;s games were boxes from his dad&#8217;s store and other items he found around there, and some of his prizes were his old toys. He took inventory of what he wanted to do, and what he had available to him and made them meet in the middle. Rather than wait for things to happen, he made them happen with what he had.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caines-arcade-3.jpg"></p>

<h3>10. Make no excuses.</h3>

<p>This kid wouldn&#8217;t have to look far to find reasons to quit. He didn&#8217;t have even a single arcade game at his disposal, had very few tools and little budget. He&#8217;s just a 9 year old kid from East L.A. who doesn&#8217;t appear to come from a rich family (though it appears his father has given him something far more valuable than money) and nobody would question him for a second about giving up. But as we know that wasn&#8217;t really an option for him. Rather than find the reasons he couldn&#8217;t do something he found ways to do it. Instead of complaining and blaming everyone else for his problems he buckled down and made it happen. Even when nobody showed up he still kept going as if it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps&#8221; was made for people like Caine.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much you can learn from 10 minutes of video, and how much you can be inspired by a 9 year old boy with a dream. Caine has earned fame, appearances and a six figure college fund. He deserves every single bit of it. He showed heart and passion you don&#8217;t often see in children or even adults these days. He had a vision and worked to make it happen. He&#8217;s got a very bright future ahead of him.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>The inspiration for this article started with a discussion I was having about successful blogs and websites.  From that I started thinking, and composed a tweet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Want to succeed? Don&#8217;t kiss ass, get walked on, hold your tongue or follow the crowd. Disrupt. Offend. Stand Out. Achieve.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got to thinking: this really is the silver bullet for a successful blog. In fact, it&#8217;s a secret to success in general. Nobody ever made a difference by following the crowd and doing what everyone was doing. So why do so many people follow this plan when they start a blog?</p>

<p>If you really want your site to take off, you have to stand out.  You have to have opinions and be ready to share them. You have to rock the boat, shake the cage and really put yourself up for scrutiny. You need to interact with people and be honest with them. Instead of worrying what everyone else is going to think, focus on what YOU think and why.</p>

<p>This is the real secret of success for the web, when it comes down to the brass tacks.</p>

<p>Some other things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give people content they want.  Ask, then listen.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to disagree with someone, even an industry expert.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid of offending people with your opinion.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to take an unpopular stance.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to be the first to try something.</li>
<li>Interact with others in the field.</li>
<li>Instead of fawning over celebrities and experts online, challenge them with good questions.</li>
<li>Keep your eye on your prize.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you try to build something that everyone likes you&#8217;ll fail.  Don&#8217;t worry about anyone else, just create. Let your personality shine through and do what you want to do. The more you enjoy it the better you&#8217;ll do at it.</p>

<p>Stop making excuses, get out there and do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a reader of this site you don&#8217;t see a ton of predictions as compared to basic observations. This site was never meant to be a crystal ball and I&#8217;ve never been much of a psychic. I&#8217;d put some good money on what I&#8217;m going to tell you today, however.</p>

<p><em>Note: This is going to be the first of my &#8220;short and sweet&#8221; type articles I&#8217;m going to put up here. They&#8217;re not meant to be in depth or drawn out like most of my articles, but simple seeds to get you thinking about a topic.</em></p>

<p>Today I am going to make a prediction about the future of SEO (with Google at least). Here it is:</p>

<p><strong>The future of SEO is going to be heavily weighted on reputation. Google authorship is your opportunity to get a jump on it. </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results-large.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/profile-picture-google-results-large-300x204.jpg" alt="How to display profile picture next to your Google results" /></a></p>

<p>I wrote last week <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/seo-blog/search-engine-optimization/how-to-display-your-profile-picture-in-google-search-results/">how to put your picture in your search results</a>. It is a way to put your smiling mug next to the results that come up in Google. This is useful for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It adds an image to your search results, and images almost always help get attention and clicks.</p></li>
<li><p>It adds a personal touch to the result, and gives you familiarity.</p></li>
<li><p>It helps you brand yourself.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>All this for free, with such a small time investment? Why wouldn&#8217;t you do this? But there is more to it. Google is starting to look to <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/authorship/index.html">authorship</a>, which is really just a fancy way to claim your own articles and content. You should start doing this&#8230; now. This is going to be a major metric in the future to determine whether you&#8217;re a lame spammer who dumps spun articles all over the net, or a serious professional, and influencer in your field.</p>

<p>If this happens and Google starts using this as a strong metric, where will you fall?</p>

<p><strong>The Losers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>People using spun articles and markov crap.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogs full of RSS scrapes</p></li>
<li><p>People who submit shoddy articles to every site on the net loaded with links</p></li>
<li><p>Sites with little or no valuable content.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>The Winners:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>People who write genuine, original and helpful articles.</p></li>
<li><p>Blogs with lots of useful information</p></li>
<li><p>Sites with known good authors contributing to them.</p></li>
<li><p>Sites with good articles</p></li>
<li><p>People who submit quality useful articles to great sites</p></li>
<li><p>People who interact with their audience.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m taking my own advice here, by getting more involved in my own site, trying to put out quality stuff and claiming my writing on other sites that I like. I&#8217;m also trying to engage more people in Google+.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s definitely something to think about for the next year and beyond.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/reasons-to-use-google-plus.jpg"></p>

<p>Google+ was launched in June of last year and was poised to be &#8220;the Facebook killer&#8221;. Naturally that didn&#8217;t happen and people are already sounding the death knell for Google+ due to slow adaptation and abandonment. But I&#8217;m not ready to give up on Google+ yet, as a marketer or as a user, and I&#8217;ll give you some reasons why.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to start by saying I don&#8217;t think it will kill or take over Facebook. It has permeated nearly every part of our society and it&#8217;s widely adopted by a lot of people.</p>

<p>Myspace almost had this level of critical mass, but it was seen as &#8220;cheesy&#8221; and more of a kids thing than something serious. Facebook doesn&#8217;t have that problem so they achieved a higher adoption than Myspace ever did. It would take a lot of factors for Google+ to beat Facebook, basically Facebook would have to mess up really bad, and consistently, and Google would have to blow us away with great features. I don&#8217;t see that happening anytime soon.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not giving up on Google+:</p>

<h3>1. It&#8217;s Google</h3>

<p>I would never say Google is too big to fail, but they do have some considerable clout and have the resources to build great products. While the public has been slow to embrace it they&#8217;re still using the gmail service and Facebook as two separate entities, and the idea of having just one is very appealing. So far Facebook has dominated social media and failed at an attempt at email, while Google has dominated email and failed at attempts at social media. Facebook might be winning but if I were a betting man, I&#8217;d bet on the incredibly innovative search giant before the popularity machine.</p>

<h3>2. It&#8217;s integrated with all my Google Services</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/how-many-users-google-plus-300x186.jpg"> I use a lot of Google services frequently. I use Gmail and Google chat, and use my Android phone to use both. Analytics, Google Drive, Documents, etc. So Google+ is just a natural step for me, it&#8217;s very easy and convenient. The problem is there is hardly anyone there. But reading Google+ postings and putting up my own is easy to do from one place. Also my email contacts are ported in which is very convenient.</p>

<h3>3. Its more fun to use</h3>

<p>The first time I tried Linux, I remember it feeling a bit uncomfortable, because I was used to Windows. But then when I got the hang of it I ended up liking it a lot better. Now I only power into Windows when I absolutely need it because I like the &#8220;feel&#8221; of Linux. This is exactly how I am about Google+. I just like the interface and &#8220;feel&#8221; of it. It&#8217;s more readable, seems to be much faster and it hasn&#8217;t been taken over by stupid requests for *ville games and the like. Sharing information is easy, sparks is kinda cool and circles is a lot easier than the Facebook equivalent.</p>

<h3>4. The crowd is a little smarter</h3>

<p>Are there smart people on Facebook? Of course, but let&#8217;s face it everyone is on Facebook and not everyone is a Genius. I&#8217;ve noticed that the people who use Google+ seem to be a bit more hip, more intelligent and better behaved than the Facebook crowd. Even the professionals I follow for Programming and SEO seem to post a lot more stuff on Google+, and interact more. Maybe Facebook is just destined to become the same digital ghetto that myspace is, but i see a lot more stuff on there that I simply don&#8217;t see on Google+. Call me a jerk, elitist or whatever it&#8217;s just a better neighborhood.</p>

<h3>5. There is an SEO Benefit coming for Google+ users</h3>

<p>Now this part is pure speculation on my part, but I have a feeling Google Authorship is going to be a huge shift this year. The articles you write on your blog and elsewhere can be tied to your Google+ profile (and i recommend it)and this allows you to make sure that content on the net that you create is attributed to your identity. I have a theory that this identity is going to be used as a factor when ranking said articles. How many people follow you, vote up your content and how you respond to your audience will all be factored in to this part of the algorithm.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Google will be boosting up your site just because you use Google+, but I think a well respected author with authority will certainly be seeing a boost from his or her content with this addition. Again all speculation but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m right.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I almost gave up on Google+ but I&#8217;ve recently come back to it, and really enjoy it. I try to update it regularly and hope to build a good audience I can chat with like i do on Twitter and Facebook. From a marketing point of view I think it would be somewhat tough to sell stuff on Google+, but of course it&#8217;s possible. A better goal for most people would probably be to shoot for improving their brand awareness and customer interactions with Google+.</p>

<p>As a casual user I don&#8217;t want to give it up because there is so much good info posted on it, I find great stuff every day. If you want, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JeremyMorgan">follow me or add me to a circle</a>! See you there!</p>
