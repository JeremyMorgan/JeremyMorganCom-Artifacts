  <div class="entry-content"><p>SEO is an interesting game. Most people&#8217;s perception of it seems to be gaming the search engine with tricks and deception to get good rankings and thousands of customers. Images of millions of dollars pouring in can convince people to do some pretty crazy things to get good search engine traffic. These are some of the things that will get you banned by Google, and other large search engines.</p>

<p><strong>Most of what people tell you about SEO is wrong. </strong></p>

<p>If you ask someone with a pedestrian knowledge of SEO they&#8217;ll usually give the same old tricks and advice. Put in your meta tags, load up your text with repetitive keywords and make sure to put these keywords at the bottom of the page. For an extra trick, try coloring the text white with CSS on a white background so people can&#8217;t see it, but Google will see it and push you to the top.</p>

<p>This stuff is horribly wrong. Some of these &#8220;tricks&#8221; worked in the early 2000s for a while, but Google fixed it. Even worse, Google will often &#8220;ban&#8221; your site from their index completely leaving you high and dry. But for some reason years later I still hear people talking about these awful tactics and thinking it works. Since I am guessing you don&#8217;t want to get your site dropped from Google completely, I&#8217;ll share some of these &#8220;tricks&#8221; that people recommend that will actually get you in trouble with Google.</p>

<p><strong>Common Tactics that Will Get You Banned</strong></p>

<p>These tactics are the most common one I see customers and friends falling for. These tactics not only fail to work, but they&#8217;ll get you booted. Think getting 50 hits a day from a search engine sucks? Try none at all. That&#8217;s what your end result will be.</p>

<p><strong>1.  500 domains pointing to one actual website. </strong></p>

<p>This one is entirely too common. People purchase every possible misspelling of their domain as well as tons of &#8220;keyword loaded&#8221; domains such as cheap-awesome-showerheads-purchase-in-hillsboro.com. They then point all of these domains at one website. This is a horrible idea.</p>

<p>In theory it makes a lot of sense, you get 20 hits a day to 50 websites and it all adds up to great free traffic to your site. In reality what happens is these other domains are not index and worse yet, the one you point them to gets banned from Google as well. Don&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cloaked pages</strong></p>

<p>Cloaked pages are one of the golden tips of 2001 - You create a page made just for a search engine, full of keywords and text optimized for a term you&#8217;re shooting for. Usually it&#8217;s something popular but irrelevant.  The page for &#8220;Osama Bin Laden Death Photos&#8221; is what google sees, but once people click on the link, they&#8217;re taken to your shower head website.</p>

<p>Not only does this not work, but even if it did you&#8217;d just be getting irrelevant traffic anyway. People searching for the Bin Laden photos would just end up seeing shower heads, and close the window.</p>

<p><strong>3. Hidden Text</strong></p>

<p>This one is another one from the golden age of easy SEO. Just put a couple hundred keywords at the bottom of the page, and use CSS to change the color so it blends in with the background of the page.</p>

<p>Not only does this not work, but it will get you banned. Also it looks extremely tacky when people find out you&#8217;ve done it. Why bother?</p>

<p><strong>5. Keyword Loading</strong></p>

<p>Another poor tactic is keyword loading. People shoot for a certain density and start inserting their keywords all over their text, rendering it unreadable and tacky. Is this the image you want to display to your clients? Not only does it not work but it compromises the integrity of the site and company plus it will probably get you banned.</p>

<p><strong>6. Tricky Code or Redirects</strong></p>

<p>This is where people put in code to show google a different page, much like cloaking. They also put in &#8220;refreshes&#8221; that will change the location in their browser to your new site. This again is a horrible idea because it will get you banned and make your site look pretty amateur.</p>

<p><strong>7. Spammy Techniques</strong></p>

<p>So you&#8217;re commenting on every blog with your keywords as your name and posting random useless posts all over forums to get your signature noticed. This is always a bad idea, because not only does it annoy other webmasters, but it doesn&#8217;t really work. Again you compromise the impression of your company that people get, because it looks really tacky and desperate when you do this.  Stay away from spamming especially for long term goals. It will only hurt you in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Good SEO is based on honesty. It&#8217;s ok to clean up your code, put some keywords in and try to nail some good results. But you have to ask yourself: am I being honest with my visitors? Anytime you try a miracle trick or doorway page you&#8217;re being deceptive. Internet marketing is one area where deceptive doesn&#8217;t work well. Also Google&#8217;s algorithm is far too complex to not notice these things. When you get flagged for spamming there is no going back. I have heard of people appealing to Google to get un-banned but I haven&#8217;t seen anyone successfully change that.</p>

<p>So keep it honest, keep it real. <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769">Follow Google&#8217;s Webmaster Guidelines</a> 100%. If you do this you don&#8217;t have to worry about your site getting dropped from the index and you being left empty handed. Do it honestly and work hard and you won&#8217;t have to worry about drastic Google updates so much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For something different, here is a try at a Photoshop tutorial. I haven&#8217;t done one of these since 2001 or so, but I figure I&#8217;d share this little trick for making cool gel buttons in Photoshop.</p>

<p>I originally used some tutorials to learn this then made some tweaks and tricks of my own which I will share here.</p>

<p>Here is the gel button:
<a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg" alt="Gel button in photoshop" /></a></p>

<p><strong>1. File -> New</strong></p>

<p>Create an image that&#8217;s 250px wide and 250px tall. The size here really doesn&#8217;t matter, just choose something in that range. Leave the background contents transparent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Choose your colors</strong></p>

<p>For this tutorial we&#8217;re making a purple button, so the colors I chose are:</p>

<p>Background: #7d0f58 (125,15,88)
Foreground: #a60d73 (166,13,115)</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-01.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-01.jpg" alt="Gel Button Photoshop Tutorial" /></a></p>

<p>Select the Arrow shown above to switch the colors so the darker color is on top.</p>

<p><strong>3. Create a new layer named &#8220;shape&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Select Layer -> New -> Layer (Ctrl+shift+N)</p>

<p><strong>4. Use the Rounded Rectangle Tool to create a rectangle</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-02.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-02.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>This is the base for the button we&#8217;re going to create.</p>

<p>Switch the colors again so the lighter color is on top</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-03.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-03.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>5. Rasterize the Layer </strong></p>

<p>Right click on the layer containing the shape and select &#8220;rasterize&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-04.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-04.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This will make it so we can make modifications to the shape.</p>

<p><strong>6. Hold down the Control Key and click on the layer to select the shape. </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-05.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-05.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></p>

<p><strong>7. Select a Paintbrush and make a highlight</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-06.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-06.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></strong></p>

<p>Use the brush to highlight the middle:<strong> </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-07.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-07.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect, in fact a little imperfection looks pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>8. Choose Filter -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-08.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-08.jpg" alt="Tutorial: Create a Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>Select a radius of around 10 pixels.</p>

<p><strong>9. Create a gloss shape</strong></p>

<p>Create a new layer, and make another rounded rectangle shape:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-091.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-091.jpg" alt="Gel Button in Photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>Now Hide that shape, but click on the layer so you get the selection:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-10.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-10.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Create a new layer, and throw a white gradient in using these settings:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-11.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-11.jpg" alt="Photoshop Tutorial for Gel Buttons" /></a></p>

<p>It should look something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-12.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-12.jpg" alt="Photoshop Tutorials" /></a></p>

<p>Now click on <strong>Select -> Modify -> Expand</strong> and choose 10 pixels.</p>

<p>Then <strong>Filter -> Blur -> Gaussian Blur</strong> at 10 pixels.</p>

<p>Now select the gloss layer, and push the<strong> up arrow </strong>to move it up a little.</p>

<p>The finished product should look like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-13.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-13.jpg" alt="Glossy button in photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>You can then insert something under the gloss, and it looks like a button:</p>

<p><a href="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg"><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gel-button-photoshop-14.jpg" alt="Gel button in photoshop" /></a></p>

<p>This is a pretty subtle button, you can do more to change it around, like playing with the gradients, opacity and rounding the corners more. You can put a slight bevel on it and make it look even more like a button.
I hope this helps get you on your way to making cool gel buttons!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having a fast website has tons of advantages. Besides being better for SEO and getting crawled by search engines, it&#8217;s without a doubt better for your visitors. So here I will give a list that will explore some free ways to make your website faster.</p>

<h3><img src="http://jeremymorgan.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/racecar.jpg" alt="How to make your Website Faster" />1. Image Optimization</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the most important areas to focus on when optimizing is images. They&#8217;re considerably larger than text files, and small image optimizations can go a long way towards making a site faster. Some ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use &#8220;lossy&#8221; compression such as .jpg for photographs and images with a lot of color.</p></li>
<li><p>Use &#8220;lossless&#8221; compression (.gif, .png) for logos, line art, or images with few colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Size your images in true dimension, do not use html to size images.</p></li>
<li><p>Smush your images using <a href="http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/">Smush.it </a>to further optimize them.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider scaling down anything that might be less noticeable if you lose some image quality.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>2. Get Good Hosting</h3>

<p>Good hosting is worth every penny. Jimmy&#8217;s discount hosting might be cheap, but can it handle a huge traffic influx? Is it slow delivering large  files? Hosting with a good service or  on a cloud is important, especially for high traffic sites. Also consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hosting images on a separate domain, such as Amazon S3</p></li>
<li><p>Host large files on a separate server</p></li>
<li><p>Host databases on a separate server</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Good hosting is a crucial part of speed. Also see the item on server optimization if you&#8217;re hosting your own site.</p>

<h3>3. Improve your code</h3>

<p>If you are using a CMS or any other web software to generate your pages, make sure the code is optimized. There are many different ways of doing the same thing when it comes to software, so take the extra time to make sure it&#8217;s optimized. If it&#8217;s beyond your programming skill level, hire someone to take a look at it.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ensure HTML is clean and light as possible</p></li>
<li><p>Use CSS to style, not html. Also use DIVs, not tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t make unnecessary database calls</p></li>
<li><p>Dont generate useless code, or find ways to consolidate.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While it may not seem like much, shaving off a few tenths of a second here and there can really add up when your site is really busy, and combined can make page loads seem much faster.</p>

<p>Static code can be just as important, yet often overlooked. Make sure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Write clean html with no unneeded code and make sure CSS is used for presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Break up your CSS into multiple files. Load only the CSS attributes you need for that page.</p></li>
<li><p>Break up your JavaScript in the same way. Don&#8217;t load JavaScript you aren&#8217;t going to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Put your CSS and JavaScript in separate files rather than inline in your pages</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Make sure your code is W3C valid or at least close. This helps a lot with optimization and SEO.</p>

<h3>4. Minify Everything!</h3>

<p>This one is a rather small change, but can be significant over time. To &#8220;minify&#8221; a file you&#8217;re basically removing all the white space and cramming everything into one line of a text file.  This reduces the file size considerably. Things you can minify:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>HTML</p></li>
<li><p>CSS</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anything text based can be minified, but make a note<strong> always keep the original file for editing</strong>! You don&#8217;t want to try and edit a minified file, it can be quite a chore. There are many tools such as <a href="http://refresh-sf.com/yui/">Yahoo! online minifiers</a> that do a great job of quickly slimming them down.</p>

<h3>5. Get rid of the slow stuff.</h3>

<p>Anything slow has to go, or be used sparingly. Just a few slow objects can make a page move like a slug. Don&#8217;t use it unless you have to, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flash - Replace it with some Ajax if you can.</p></li>
<li><p>SSL (don&#8217;t make the whole site run under https. Only use it when you are protecting information in trasnsit.)</p></li>
<li><p>External Javascript - Cool widgets from other sites are great, but if they are slow remove them.</p></li>
<li><p>Hi Res Images</p></li>
<li><p>Videos that load and play instantly on the page.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>6. Optimize your Database</h3>

<p>If possible, host your database on a separate server. Some web hosts offer this by default. This separates web operations from database, and can make things much faster. Also:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Optimize your data model</p></li>
<li><p>Use indexes properly and to your advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize your queries - lots of joins</p></li>
<li><p>Stored Procedures are your friend. Learn how you can utilize them to your advantage.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t store things in the database that never change. Make it static.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the OPTIMIZE command on MySQL frequently.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>7. Configure your server properly.</h3>

<p>This isn&#8217;t an option for everyone, because most people have a hosting account where they cant change things, and also many people don&#8217;t know how. Very few webmasters are also server admins but if you are this is a place you can really squeeze some extra performance.</p>

<p>Some things to really pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Memory Allocation</p></li>
<li><p>Open processes</p></li>
<li><p>Caching settings</p></li>
<li><p>External Image hosting</p></li>
<li><p>Gzip (turn it on)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove unnecessary Apache/IIS modules.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a profiler (IIS has it&#8217;s own built in) to check changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Check out some server accelerators.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Going into great detail is not within the scope of this article, but the more you can learn about this stuff the better. If you end up with a successful site and have thousands of visitors hourly, you will need to have all these &#8220;small details&#8221; worked out to maintain good performance.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you notice a theme here, it&#8217;s &#8220;little things count&#8221;. Each thing will only help a tiny bit, but combined they make a significant difference. I preach the same theory with SEO, any change by itself doesn&#8217;t help but combined they&#8217;ll push you farther than you were before. So before breaking out your wallet try some of these things!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a simple introduction to XSLT, or eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation. It&#8217;s a way of applying styles and formatting to XML files, and it&#8217;s pretty useful. It&#8217;s yet another acronym you see thrown around on job descriptions for Web Developers. Don&#8217;t be scared, it&#8217;s really easy to understand.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll start out with a simple XML file listing a few movies.</p>

<h3>XML Breakdown</h3>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have to spend a lot of time explaining this file, you should already have a basic familiarity with XML if you want to build XML Stylesheets. This file contains three movies, as part of a &#8220;collection&#8221; and lists the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Genre</li>
</ul>


<p>If we load this file into a browser as it is, the page that displays will look like it does above, just an XML readout.  But we added something to our file, notice this line:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="cp">&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;movies.xsl&quot; type=&quot;text/xsl&quot;?&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is where we reference movies.xsl which will be our XML stylesheet.  We simply put in an href to the file, and a type.</p>

<p>Our xsl file will be somewhat different, essentially a blend of an XML file and an HTML file. What this sheet is doing is applying presentation to the XML elements.  You can build tables, lists or anything else you can do in a standard html webpage. Here is one I built for this tutorial:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>         <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;genre&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>         <span class="nt">&lt;td&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;year&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nt">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;/table&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>XSL Breakdown</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s break down this file a bit. First we find the XML start tag, and then our first XSL tag, which is</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:stylesheet</span> <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">&quot;1.0&quot;</span> <span class="na">xmlns:xsl=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is an important line, because it specifies the version and namespace of the stylesheet. The next important line is line #4:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:template</span> <span class="na">match=</span><span class="s">&quot;/collection&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This specifies which group to start with. Our sample XML file only has one group, &#8220;Collection&#8221;. But you may have several groups and you can keep them all in one big XML file. You can then use a stylesheet to display them all in different areas, and different ways. We could decide to add a list of favorite TV shows, for instance and put that in another group. This line simply tells us which group this particular template is for.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice we start building an HTML page below it, complete with a table to display our data.</p>

<p>Then we have another important line:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;xsl:for-each</span> <span class="na">select=</span><span class="s">&quot;movie&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a basic &#8220;for each&#8221; loop found in many programming languages. It basically states, &#8220;for each movie, we will do ___&#8221;. So it creates a loop and goes through every &#8220;movie&#8221; tag until it&#8217;s done. This is how the rows are populated.</p>

<p>After that we close up the table and the html and drop in tags to close the template, and the style sheet:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These are pretty self explanatory, we want to close up any open tags, if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll get an error.</p>

<h3>Some things to note:</h3>

<p><strong>Your coding has to be really good.</strong> - Most of the time just one open tag will break the entire thing.</p>

<p><strong>Not all browsers process XSLT stylesheets, including many mobile devices. </strong>You will need to use a XSLT parser for those pages, and I&#8217;ll do a tutorial for that soon.</p>

<p><strong>We&#8217;re just scratching the surface </strong>- XSLT uses XPath to query XML files, there are a lot more cool things you can do with this technology once you get the hang of it. Check out an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp">XPath tutorial</a> and take a look. I&#8217;ve seen entire sites built with XML files and XSLT that would surprise you with what they&#8217;ve done.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Till next time, have fun!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple weeks ago I wrote about <a href="http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/google-algorithm-update-takes-aim-at-content-farms/">Google changing it&#8217;s algorithm</a> to combat &#8220;content farms&#8221;, and it&#8217;s arguably the most talked about news in the SEO industry this year. It&#8217;s effects are being felt, from actual content farms to ordinary legitimate sites.  This brings up an important question: should we be relying on SEO for revenue at all?</p>

<h3>The Fallout From the Algorithm Update Begins</h3>

<p>Surely by now you&#8217;ve read other articles about the latest Google update, and you&#8217;ve probably seen some pretty active discussions about it in Webmaster/SEO forums. Maybe you&#8217;ve also read about <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/03/02/mahalo-lays-off-10-of-staff/">Mahalo laying off 10% of it&#8217;s staff</a> and you&#8217;re thinking there&#8217;s a pretty good chance some innocent people got caught in the crossfire here. Is it possible that people who were doing everything right got mistaken for a content farm and lost rankings?</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this has happened. Many times webmasters that are doing everything by Google&#8217;s guidelines get hit by these drastic algorithm updates. Some would say it&#8217;s a pure numbers game; someone has to fall within the margin of error. Some say the algorithms changes are poorly thought out and executed, and Google simply doesn&#8217;t care if innocents are harmed. Yet another small conspiracy-minded group thinks Google takes down some innocent sites to get them to start purchasing more adwords ads. Whatever the case may be I know innocent sites are being punished, and there is little you can do about it.</p>

<h3>Should You Depend on SEO at All?</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve often advised my clients that SEO should always be treated as gravy, an extra bonus to boost your marketing plan. This doesn&#8217;t mean SEO cannot bring the majority of your business, because it often does. But you should base most of your planning on the revenue you bring in through traditional marketing means.</p>

<p>There is no safety in business, your success is based on risk taking which is why some succeed, and most fail. If it weren&#8217;t risky everyone would do it. But you shouldn&#8217;t take unnecessary risks and depend on SEO traffic, because it can disappear in a day. When you do your home budget, do you purchase things based on the potential of winning the lottery? You should always work with a contingency plan and don&#8217;t make large plans based on great SEO rankings.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket, because SEO is simply too volatile to trust. You can be doing everything right, and staying perfectly white hat and legal and lose it all. You don&#8217;t own Google, and nobody outside Google truly knows the inner workings so it&#8217;s best to treat it as a free gift you can&#8217;t rely on.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all gravy, and should be treated as such. Use the revenue generated by successful SEO to fund offline marketing programs or online advertising. Keep pushing your product&#8217;s potential and focusing on making it sell itself. Don&#8217;t rely on something you have no control over that could vanish overnight.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard or read the name &#8220;Charlie Sheen&#8221; last week, congratulations on managing to seal yourself away from all media. His very public breakdown has been all everyone is talking about. His all out, reckless self promotion is working great, but is it a good business approach?</p>

<h3>Better to Burn Out Than Fade Away</h3>

<p>The famous line from Kurt Cobain&#8217;s suicide note (and taken from a Def Leppard song) is no doubt the approach Charlie is taking. He&#8217;s outrageous, in your face and no holds barred. He&#8217;s talking to anyone who will listen and saying the most shocking things he can think of, while flaunting his rock star lifestyle.</p>

<p>There is  no doubt he started this run already famous, with decades of movies and a hit TV show under his belt, but now he&#8217;s in the news and on the web daily. He&#8217;s the hot topic, and growing hotter.</p>

<p>But is this an approach YOU can take with your company or brand?</p>

<p>Can you be outrageous, offensive and reckless?</p>

<p>Will it work?</p>

<h3>Charlie Sheen as a business strategy.</h3>

<p>There is no doubt he&#8217;s cashing in on this latest trainwreck of a media frenzy he&#8217;s caused. You could do the same if you wanted. You can be outrageous, over the top, offensive and out of control. You can create viral videos of yourself doing something incredibly stupid with your website on your back. You could do something incredibly offensive, and your enemies will advertise for you.</p>

<p>You can pull out all the stops and do whatever it takes to become famous. Your company or brand can be the trending topic on Twitter and you could get bloggers to go crazy talking about you, and you too would cash in. You could make giant piles of money cashing in on this instant fame.</p>

<p>But what about next month, when they&#8217;ve forgotten about you? What about next year? These waves never truly last, and it&#8217;s hard to keep people&#8217;s attention for long. What will you do then? Will you take the pile of cash and make something else work? Will anyone care?</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re infamous, the only thing people remember long term is the bad. The negative things associated with you will stay. Your credibility will be shot. Not only will people fail to take you seriously, they won&#8217;t trust you. You can no longer hold your head up high and have people look up to you. A turnaround is always possible, but very difficult to do.</p>

<p>Is this what you really want for your company, and your brand? Are you doing things just to get attention that you could regret later?  Is your reputation worth it?</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>
