    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Repeatable installs are all the rage in Devops these days. As developers we have this "automate everything" mentality, and for good reason. In this article I'll show you how you can do that with IIS installation as well. There's no reason to go hunting and pecking around the GUI every time you need to do this. This is the just one of many ways to automate IIS installs, which I'll be covering in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>I also cover this in depth in <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Finstalling-configuring-iis" target="_blank">my latest Pluralsight course</a> on Installing IIS.</p>

<h3>Why would I ever need to do this?</h3>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops.jpg" title="&#34;How To Create Repeatable Installs in IIS&#34;" alt="&#34;How To Create Repeatable Installs in IIS&#34;"></p>

<p>Most of the time administrators probably have a task like "throw IIS on the server and make sure the application works" and they do just that. That's how I used to do it too. I was working on a project many years ago that required us to spin up VM servers on a virtual network as a "stack".</p>

<p>This stack was a small snapshot of our production network, so to make sure our software worked with everyone's updates, we had to build a new stack a few times a week.</p>

<p>A few times a week, we'd have to click through the GUI install and remember each box to check. Yeah, you can get good at it but it's a waste of time.</p>

<p>Naturally I had to find a way to automate it, and break out some PowerShell. You do this, because you save time that can be spent doing fun stuff. So let's learn how to create automated, repeatable IIS installations.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>So you're an administrator for ACME Widgets and you want to create a custom install of IIS and make it automated. You create a new server and are ready to go.</p>

<p>To find out if IIS is installed, we'll run a command called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/what-is-dism" target="_blank">DISM</a>. DISM is a tool to build and service Windows images, it's mostly used to create and maintain images for Virtual Machines, it's extremely powerful, but we'll cover that in a future article. For now we'll use it to check features on the machine.</p>

<p>Open up a command prompt, and run the following command:</p>

<p><code>
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-WebServer
</code></p>

<p>As I run it on my virtual machine, I can see that IIS is not yet installed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-01.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>You can also find a list of everything that's enabled with this command:</p>

<p><code>
DISM /online /get-features /format:table | find "Enabled"
</code></p>

<p>And you'll see something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-02.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>by piping the output into find and searching for enabled we can get a full list of features that are already enabled on the server.</p>

<p>We can also quickly see if a single feature is enabled like we did before, but piping the results into find and checking the state:</p>

<p><code>
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-WebServer | find "State"
</code></p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-03.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>Here we can quickly and clearly see IIS is not installed.</p>

<h3>Creating a Batch File</h3>

<p>So now that we know we can get this type of output, we're going to build a little batch file to do it, and we'll run the command a little different this time. This is pretty light programming, but it will be a set of tests to see if particular items are installed.</p>

<p>Type in notepad webinstall.bat and let's create a batch file. Add the following:</p>

<p><code>
@ECHO OFF
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-WebServer | find "State : Disabled" &gt; nul
</code></p>

<p>We're typing in dism, online, get-featureinfo, featurename, then piping that to find. We'll look for state saying disabled, and if that phrase is found, that means IIS is disabled, or not installed. That will change our error level, which we'll add next.</p>

<p><code>
if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
echo "IIS Web Server is not installed"
)
</code>
If our error level is set to zero, that means the phrase state enabled was found in our output. Let's test it out.</p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-04.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>Now in our batch file we can see that IIS is not installed, and we have a block inside the statement to install IIS.</p>

<p>We could do that with a block of code like this:</p>

<p><code>
if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
echo "IIS Web Server is not installed"
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServer /all
)
</code></p>

<p>This is the first basic IIS install script. At the end we can put a check to see if it's installed:</p>

<p><code>
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-WebServer | find "State"
</code></p>

<p>The finished batch file <a href="https://gist.github.com/JeremyMorgan/5f5ca70db82bd645d891c1aedd4e1d2b" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>

<h3>Running the Script</h3>

<p>Now after we run the file, it should do the following set of steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check to see if IIS is installed</li>
<li>If it's not installed, install it</li>
<li>Check again to see if it's installed.</li>
</ul>


<p>So the end result is, if IIS is installed it does nothing, if it's not installed then adds it, and looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-05.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>This small, simple script can make sure IIS is installed on the machine. And it's repeatable.</p>

<h3>Customizing the Install</h3>

<p>Of course as you're building your script, you may need to install other IIS modules, chances are it won't be just a plain IIS install.</p>

<p>If you run the following command, you can see everything related to IIS that can be installed here:</p>

<p><code>
dism /online /get-features | find "IIS"
</code></p>

<p>This is a good way to get a list of IIS features available:</p>

<p><img src="/images/repeatable-iis-devops/repeatable-iis-devops-06.jpg" alt="Repeatable Installs in IIS" /></p>

<p>So, if you'd like to add more IIS features, it's as easy as making more loops to check for them:</p>

<p>ASP.NET:</p>

<p>```
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-ASPNET45 | find "State : Disabled" > nul</p>

<p>if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
echo "ASPNET is not installed. We should install it."
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-ASPNET45 /all
)
```</p>

<p>HTTP Redirect:</p>

<p>```
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-HttpRedirect | find "State : Disabled" > nul</p>

<p>if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
echo "HTTP Redirect is not installed . We should install it."
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-HttpRedirect /all
)
```</p>

<p>HTTP Logging:</p>

<p>```
dism /online /get-featureinfo /featurename:IIS-HttpLogging | find "State : Disabled" > nul</p>

<p>if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
echo "HTTP Logging is not installed . We should install it."
dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-HttpLogging /all
)
```</p>

<p>You get the idea. You can build a custom installation that can be run from a batch file, quickly and easily.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So now you're set to create a neat little batch file you can run on any machine to install IIS to 100 different VMs if you want to. You can put this on an Azure stack, or run it on a development machine. As I stated I cover this and many other repeatable installations in <a href="https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Finstalling-configuring-iis" target="_blank">my latest course on Pluralsight</a>. It covers ways to effectively install IIS at a large scale.</p>

<p>You can even run DISM remotely or on VM Images that aren't even booted. It's a great tool to get to know.</p>

    <id>https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/IIS/load-testing-your-iis-web-server</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All the theory, calculations, and estimations in the world aren't going to tell you how your website will truly perform under a load. If you're deploying a new server, or doing any kind of performance enhancements you don't want to test your results in production. It's always a good idea to see how your system behaves before your visitors do. To do that, you can use a load testing tool, and here are a few I use quite frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've featured these tools is my latest IIS course on Pluralsight, <a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fiis-administration-in-depth" target="_blank">IIS Administration in Depth</a>, check it out!</p>

<h3>Netling</h3>

<p><img src="/images/load-testing-iis-web-server/load-test-iis-web-server-01.jpg" alt="Load Testing IIS Web Server" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/hallatore/Netling">Download Netling Here </a></strong></p>

<p>One of the "quick and dirty" applications I use is Netling. This is a super simple tester written in C#. You will need to compile this with Visual Studio, but you don't necessarily have to be a developer to do it. I've been able to load it up, and select build to create it with no modifications with many versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Netling is super simple to operate and about as easy as it gets.</p>

<p>You select how many threads you want to run. This is entirely up to you, more threads will put more load on your machine, and depending on how many cores your CPU has, more may not necessarily be better. Experiment with it and see what works best for you.</p>

<p>It has a feature for "Pipelining". This is when multiple requests go through a single socket without waiting for a response. Setting this higher will generate a higher load but again this something to adjust for best results.  There will be a physical limit to pipelining depending on your hardware and connection speed.</p>

<p>This is a handy tool and is extremely simple to use. One issue I've had with Netling is it sends raw requests that aren't much like a real browser. To emulate real traffic more accurately I have another tool I like to use.</p>

<h3>Netling Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Open Source, can be easily modified</li>
<li>Extremely Simple</li>
</ul>


<h3>Netling Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't simulate real transactions well</li>
<li>Can't do authentication or other simulations</li>
<li>Only tests one URL at a time</li>
</ul>


<h3>Web Surge</h3>

<p><img src="/images/load-testing-iis-web-server/load-test-iis-web-server-02.jpg" alt="Load Testing IIS Web Server" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://websurge.west-wind.com/">Download Web Surge Here</a></strong></p>

<p>Web surge is by far one of my favorites. It's a great application that simulates a load on your server in a very realistic fashion.</p>

<p>With this program you create sessions, which means you can use more than one URL for the test. Each of the URLs will be run in the session, which can make it more random and realistic. It has a ton of great options as well:</p>

<p><img src="/images/load-testing-iis-web-server/load-test-iis-web-server-03.jpg" alt="Load Testing IIS Web Server" /></p>

<p>It gives you quick results, and you can "drill down" to get more detailed data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/load-testing-iis-web-server/load-test-iis-web-server-04.jpg" alt="Load Testing IIS Web Server" /></p>

<p>You can also export these results in several formats. There's the Websurge proprietary format, as well as XML or JSON. You could parse these results for future analysis work.</p>

<p>Overall Websurge is among my favorites for load testing because it's closer to real world traffic. If you put in a list of all your pages and randomize the test, it can provide some solid information.</p>

<h3>Web Surge Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Free (for personal use)</li>
<li>Professional Version reasonably priced</li>
<li>Fast and generates a large load</li>
<li>Simple to use, yet powerful</li>
<li>Simulates "real world" traffic very well</li>
<li>Extremely configurable</li>
</ul>


<h3>Web Surge Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>None than I can think of</li>
</ul>


<h2>Apache JMeter</h2>

<p><img src="/images/load-testing-iis-web-server/load-test-iis-web-server-05.jpg" alt="Load Testing IIS Web Server" /></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/">Download JMeter Here </a></strong></p>

<p>The Next application we'll look at is Jmeter. This is an extremely powerful program and can do very thorough testing in addition to generating a load. In fact load testing with Jmeter is just a very small part of it's overall functionality.</p>

<p>With JMeter you have scenarios to run out, because it's more of a testing oriented application you can run through a longer set of steps and processes as a part of your test.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to really dig into this application and learn as much as you can about it to get the full benefits of it.</p>

<h3>Apache JMeter Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Very Powerful</li>
<li>Detailed tests can be set up</li>
<li>Minimal setup</li>
</ul>


<h3>Apache JMeter Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Steeper learning curve</li>
<li>Can be fairly complicated</li>
<li>May be overkill for what you need</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are many tools out there for load generation, but these are the ones I use the most. I like to set up various different tests to accurately gauge performance of your website and it's reaction to a load.</p>

<p>In fact, the reaction to a heavy load is the most important thing I'm looking for. When doing performance measurements it's difficult to really nail down all the variables and prove a change has increased performance. But sending a heavy load to your server and seeing how it reacts is pretty conclusive.</p>

<p>I cover some performance and stability enhancements in my <strong><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fiis-administration-fundamentals">Pluralsight Course - IIS Administration Fundamentals</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I cover load testing in detail in my new course <strong><a href="http://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1221983/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fiis-administration-in-depth">IIS Administration In Depth</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>What Is an Application Pool?</h3>

<p>To understand Application Pools, we must first understand applications, as far as IIS is concerned.</p>

<p>An <strong>application</strong> is a set of files and folders that deliver content. Any website will have a default application assigned to it, even if it's just HTML and images. The diagram below shows the web server / web site / application relationship:</p>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-01.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>An <strong>Application Pool</strong> is a container for your applications. It serves to isolate your application from other applications on the server. Each application in an application pool shares a worker process (w3wp.exe). You can have several applications share the same worker process, or have one for each application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-00.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>When setting up Application Pools, you have a few options. Let's compare a couple patterns.</p>

<h4>Multiple Applications in Single Pool</h4>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-02.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>With this setup every application shares the same pool/process. Some reasons you may want to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simpler Design</li>
<li>When making changes you only have to do it once.</li>
<li>Caching is improved, code can be shared and cached between applications</li>
</ul>


<p>Some reasons you may not want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>One crash takes down every application</li>
<li>An application with high load will slow the others</li>
<li>All applications share the same security profile</li>
<li>One applications required setting may break another application.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Each application has its own application pool</h4>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-03.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>With this setup each application has it's own unique process.</p>

<p>Some reasons you may want to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isolated operations - if one application fails it doesn't affect the others.</li>
<li>Isolated performance - a higher load application (most likely) will not slow the other applications down.</li>
<li>Security can be configured for each application individually.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some reasons you may not want to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Settings cannot be changed globally, must do one by one.</li>
<li>Common code caching advantage not present.</li>
<li>Could create more overhead than a single pool.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is no "magic bullet" for this, it will depend on your website and the needs of your organization. It's definitely something you want to experiment with for best results.</p>

<h3>Application Pool Settings</h3>

<p>There are some important settings to consider with Application Pools. If you choose the basic settings you don't get much:</p>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-04.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>This only allows you to change your CLR version and Managed pipeline mode. But choose advanced settings and you get far more options:</p>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-05.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>Here are some ones I've often seen changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>.Net CLR</strong>- Although there isn't a great reason to run a lower version of .Net it does happen. Usually I find myself setting this when the default app pool framework is 2.0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enable 32 Bit applications</strong> - This is a common one for backwards compatibility. For instance the last application I worked on that required this used 32 bit DLLs written in C++, and the application would not function without this setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managed Pipeline Mode</strong> - This is another one used for backwards compatibility. You may need classic mode for some older ASP applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Queue Length</strong> - this is a throttling setting and it's pretty rough but useful. What we're saying here is we can have 1000 requests in the queue, and above that visitors will get a 503 error.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit</strong> - This is another throttling measure that controls the maximum percentage of CPU time you want this application pool to consume.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit Action</strong> specifies what to do when that limit is hit. You can kill the process, throttle it, or do nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limit interval</strong> is for fine tuning throttling. After the limit above is hit, this setting controls how many minutes we can stay in that state until recycling. If it's too long you may have throttling on after it's no longer needed. Too short and of an interval will just keep it throttling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identity</strong> - This is important because this is the user your application pool is impersonating. Most of the time application pool identity is your best choice, but there are times when you will need a specific user to run a process. In that case you can have this app pool run under that user's account and it's given their permissions. Don't do this unless you absolutely need to. It's something I've seen a lot in the field especially in high security applications.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>As I've said before, there is no silver bullet for tuning either. It really depends on your organization and how your website is used. A great tune on one website could be bad for another.</p>

<h3>How to Create an Application Pool</h3>

<p>Creating Application Pools in IIS is easy. You can go into IIS Manager in the <strong>Application Pools</strong> feature pane, right click and create a new one:</p>

<p><img src="/images/what-is-iis-app-pool/what-is-iis-app-pool-06.jpg" alt="What is an Application Pool" /></p>

<p>Or you could create one with PowerShell (my preferred option):</p>

<p>```
$appPoolName = 'jeremyscoolapp'</p>

<p>if(!(Test-Path IIS:\AppPools\$appPoolName))
{</p>

<pre><code>$appPool = New-Item $appPoolName
$appPool | Set-ItemProperty -Name "managedRuntimeVersion" -Value 'v4.0'
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Set-ItemProperty iis:\Sites\WebsiteName -Name applicationpool -Value $appPoolName
```</p>

<p>In this script you can see that I define a name for my Application Pool. Then, I test to see if it already exists. If it doesn't I create a new Application pool. Then I use Set-ItemProperty to change my runtime version to 4.0. You can set any of the application pool settings this way.</p>

<p>To see the options you can change type the following at a PowerShell prompt:</p>

<p><code>
Get-Item IIS:\AppPools\DefaultAppPool  | Select-Object *
</code>
Replace DefaultAppPool with the name of your application pool if it's different.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope this has given you a good introduction to application pools in IIS. Because these are created automatically often times administrators don't give a lot of thought to setting them up. Many websites run just fine with default settings. If you find yourself needing a custom configuration or you have some load issues, you now have a good understand of application pools and where to look to change them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A great tool I've discovered recently is the Failed Request Tracing Tool is IIS. If you're building an ASP.Net application and having issues with requests it's a fantastic tool. I'll show you how to use it.</p>

<p>Are you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting a 500 error with messages suppressed?</li>
<li>Getting a permission denied and don't know where it's being denied?</li>
<li>Getting an error that doesn't show up in the logs?</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these are good candidates for using the failed request tracing tool. This captures data right when the server gets hit. These are activities that happen right at the front, even before they can be logged.</p>

<p>In your IIS Manager, select your website. In the Actions panel under Manage Web Site click "Failed Request Tracing.."</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-001.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>In the next screen, you'll enable it, and click OK.</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-002.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>Next, find the "Failed Request Tracing Rules" icon, and click it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-003.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>In the next screen, we'll add a rule. Right click in the open area and select "Add"</p>

<p>Select the content you'd like to trace (I usually select all):</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-005.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>On this screen, type in 400-999 to capture the full range of errors</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-006.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>Select your trace providers (I usually select all of them)</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-007.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>Then, make a request to your web site (either through browser, ajax, etc)</p>

<p>Next in your inetpub folder under logs, you'll see a new FailedReqLogFiles folder. In there will be generated folders. Select the latest one.</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-008.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>In here you'll see a set of xml files for each individual request.</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-009.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>Double click to open it up, and you'll see very detailed information. In this case it shows I have a certificate error, that is not explained on the error page or the error log, but I've found it here and can move on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/failed-request-tracing-IIS/failed-request-tracing-IIS-010.jpg" alt="failed request tracing" /></p>

<p>And that's it! Make sure to turn it off once you've solved your problem.</p>

<p>While IIS admins have probably been using this for years, it's a helpful too for developers as well, especially ones who work on implementation as well as development.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments what you think.</p>
