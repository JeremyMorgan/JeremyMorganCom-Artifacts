I'm not sure if you've noticed this, but I got a little surprise when I went to verify a new website in Google Webmaster Tools. It now allows another option to verify: using your domain name provider.

I thought this was pretty interesting.

Step 2 is logging in, then you allow GoDaddy to access your Google Webmaster Tools account.

I think it's a pretty easy way to verify, it's much better than the "alternate methods" of adding a meta tag, text file on the server or (shakes head) adding DNS record. I think this will be a lot easier for people to do, especially beginners. 

But are there any downsides? The only thing I can think of is not wanting Google and your domain provider to talk to each other. I don't see anything wrong with it personally, considering Google can find out what domains you own thru whois information anyway, and we're not even sure that's something they care about. 

This is an interesting change I thought I'd share with everyone. Your thoughts?
