Lately I've been talking a lot with a couple friends about SEO. Both are really smart guys who are trying to break in the web development biz. And naturally they want some help with SEO and getting friends to their site.  And both have mentioned how hard it is to find good information on the net. So I figured I'd whip up a quick post showing where I get a lot of my info from.

Now of course a lot of my SEO knowledge comes from experience. Either by getting my own sites to rank up for certain terms, or helping my customers succeed. I've been doing this since 1996, so I've learned a lot about that. But I also get a lot of information from other SEOs and marketers, and I'm not afraid to admit it. So here are some of the places I go to stay "in the know".

**SEO News - Current Events. **

It's very important to stay current with what's going on in the industry. Here are some blogs I check regularly.

[The Matt Cutts Blog](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/) - Matt is not only a really smart guy who gives out a lot of info, but he actually works for Google. And he gives you a lot of good information that a "white hat" SEO can use to their advantage. While it may not be his intent, he gives out a lot of good info you should listen to.

[SEOMoz](http://www.seomoz.org/blog) - This is a company blog run by [Rand Fishkin](http://www.seomoz.org/team/randfish) - Easily one of the top SEOs the world has ever seen. Just a couple hours on this site can improve your knowledge in ways that you won't believe. If you are going to focus on one single place to learn about SEO, make this the site to go to.

[Gray Wolf's blog](http://www.wolf-howl.com/) - This blog being #2 for "SEO blog" (SEOMoz is #1)  should tell you Micheal Gray knows his stuff. Another good site that's astonishingly free, and full of good info.

[Dosh Dosh](http://www.doshdosh.com/) - Yes, the name is silly but you remember it. Once you've spend enough time here you can really figure out great ways to make money once your trafic is coming in.

[SEO Book](http://www.seobook.com/blog) - Headed by Aaron Wall who is a controversial figure in the industry, there is a lot of great info on this site. You know what they say, if you don't have haters, you aren't doing it right! Great site, and I've actually read his SEO book front to back. Well worth the investment.

[ Daily SEO Blog](http://www.dailyseoblog.com/) - This is a great site with a lot of great info. I would highly reccomend checking it out.

Anyway, these are some good daily reads, but there is a lot more out there. I will post them, and in the next post I will talk about some SEO tools that you need to succeed. This will end up being a series of articles that I think will really help people out. See you then!
