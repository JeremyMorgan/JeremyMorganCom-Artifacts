In the last installment of the Twitter Success Series, I talked about [building your tribe](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/search-engine-optimization/twitter-success-series-part-1-build-your-tribe/). I talked about ways to build your followers by keeping them happy, and getting them to spread the word. In retrospect I realize that I actually did this in reverse! In this installment I'm going to talk about how to find your "tribe"  (if this sounds familiar to you, yes I am lifting that term from [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)).

**How to get more followers on twitter. **

So now that you know how to keep your tribe happy, let's talk about ways to find your tribe! There are many ways to find followers on twitter. First off, you have to understand how twitter works. Followers are people who are following your updates. You can't force people to follow you, only entice them to. How do you do that?



	
  * Get their attention by following them.

	
  * Get "Re Tweets" from others, and having people find you.

	
  * Tweeting to other users and having them reply back (people watch conversations)

	
  * Linking to your twitter site outside of twitter, on your blog or website.

	
  * Follow Friday mentions.


So these are the best ways to get people to follow you. If you post something awesome, and someone with 10,000 followers "re tweets" it ([what is a re tweet?](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/twitter/twitter-101-for-beginners/)), they will all see a link to your profile. If they like what they see, they'll follow you. I have gathered a lot of followers this way. Conversations with others will show your @username on someone else's profile, and that is also another way to get attention. Follow friday mentions help too. (What is follow friday?)".

The fastest and most effective way is to follow others. If you follow people with similar interests, you can learn a lot. Also, if they check out your tweets and think you'll add value, they will follow you too. Here are some great tools for doing just that.

**Name:** Twollo [[website](http://www.twollo.com)]
**Type: **Web Based
**Cost:** Free (Â£4.50 a month for premium access)

**Pros: **The free version works pretty well. Adds users automatically, 24 hours a day. You can target the types of users you want to follow.

**Cons:** All adds come from same IP, so it has to abide by some limits. You're in a queue with everyone else, so adds can be kind of slow.

**Summary:** This is a great service to get started out with. If you have a lot of accounts, and want to grow a network very fast, you will definitely want to pony up for the premium access.

**Conclusion**

There are many ways of getting followers, and we've covered a few. There is one thing I can't stress enough: **Only gather followers with relevant interests!** Targeting is extremely important. It's far better to have 10 relevant followers who read your stuff than 10,000 followers who don't. If you're just trying to get big numbers, you'll be very disappointed.

Don't fall for the pyramid adding schemes that add thousands fo spammers as followers, fill up your timeline with crap and take your money. I won't mention names, but you'll know it when you see it. Only follow people you care to read, and only try to get people following you who are interested in what you have to say.

In the next edition of the Twitter Success Series, we'll talk about tools that make your life easier. There are countless twitter tools out there, and we'll go through the best ones.

Till next time, good luck in your pursuits!!
