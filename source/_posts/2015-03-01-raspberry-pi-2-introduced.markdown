So my Raspberry Pi 2 has finally arrived, and I got to take a quick look at it. Pretty impressive so far, though I haven't done much with it. If you don't know what's so great about the Raspberry Pi 2 I'll give you a quick rundown by comparing it to the others.

##Original Raspberry Pi (Model A/A+)

The original Model A Raspberry Pi models were pretty limited. They didn't have an ethernet chip, and were mostly used for robotics and similar experiments due to their low weight and power usage.

The model A+ had an Ethernet port at least, and this was the first model I used. 
It has:

- Broadcom BCM2835
- 256MB SDRAM
- SoC full HD
- SDCard Port 
- 2x USB Ports
- 26 Pin GPIO

It wasn't a bad machine at all, and well worth the price at the time. It was a pioneer of the pocket computers and I had a lot of fun with it. 

##Raspberry Pi Model B+

This was a vast improvement over the previous model. The biggest thing for me was:

- 512MB SDRAM
- 4x USB Ports
- MicroUSB Port
- 40 Pin GPIO

This model also draws more power, but performs very well. And if you want to use for an actual desktop machine the extra USB ports are helpful. 

##Raspberry Pi 2

This is a drastic change for the Pi. While the form factor is identical to the Raspberry Pi B+, it has a lot more power.

- Broadcom BCM2836 ARMv7 Quad Core Processor (900mhz)
- 1024MB SDRAM

This is rumored to be 6x faster. And in addition you'll be able to run Windows 10 on it. I am very excited about this. If you'd like to join the Microsoft IoT early adopter program, [here is the signup form](https://www.windowsondevices.com/signup.aspx). 


##Initial impressions

I haven't been able to tinker with it much yet, but it is definitely faster. The Model A/B machines have been able to be a decent, usable Linux Desktop. Its not something you'd ever want to do real work on, but it's usable. 

The Raspberry Pi 2 on the other hand is quite snappy. It's enough to be a real internet machine. If you could get a decent browser it would be unstoppable.

The real benefit of course isn't going to be using it as a desktop machine, but continuing to to use for IoT and other Maker Projects with increased memory and power. 900mhz and 1 Gig of Ram? I had a home computer with those specs not so long ago. It's exciting!

###Ideas

I am batting around a few ideas of things to build with the Pi, including a stereo/GPS setup and a media center, and a robot. But maybe you have another better idea? Send me your ideas and maybe I'll set it up and write about it!
