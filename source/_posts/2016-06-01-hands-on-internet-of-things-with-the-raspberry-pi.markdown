Great news! I finally got my IoT course done! It took a long time to develop, and a lot of learning but totally worth it. This is not really a post advertising it but just a quick talk about the process.

##Hands on Internet of Things

<a href="https://www.udemy.com/hands-on-internet-of-things-raspberry-pi/?couponCode=DOTCOMFANS">{%img /images/hands-on-iot/hands-on-iot-00.jpg "Hands on Internet of Things Udemy" %}</a>

If you're interested in taking the course, you can <a href="https://www.udemy.com/hands-on-internet-of-things-raspberry-pi/?couponCode=DOTCOMFANS">redeem a 50% off coupon by clicking here!</a> It's already dirt cheap at $20, but why not get it for $10?

In this course, I cover the basics, such as how to connect to the Pi, blink an LED, etc. Then we get into reading sensors and gathering the data. Then we walk through ways to send it to endpoints on the internet. Finally we create our OWN endpoint and start sending data there. Finally we build a dashboard for our data. Sound fun? Sign up!!

##What I learned here 

I learned a few things over the months. I started out not knowing much about video or sound editing. I also knew next to nothing about course design. I'm not an expert at any of those things now but I have learned a lot. Some key points I learned:

- Course design is hard. 
- Video editing is hard.
- Audio editing is hard. 
- Every sound within 10 miles comes in very loudly on your microphone. 


So I set off with my Yeti Blue microphone, and purchased some software to help out:

- Camtasia for Mac
- Camtasia for PC
- Reaper Audio
- ACON Audio plugins

I read through countless tutorials and and watched videos to learn as much as I could. Then I started to record random stuff and chop it up, clean it etc. Lots of trial by fire, and my early work was terrible. 

###Sound: My Biggest Obstacle

One thing I learned quickly: The world is loud. The Yeti Blue microphone is AMAZING and the sound quality is great. Unfortunately it picks up sounds everwhere. I had many fruitless hours recording and re-recording when a dog barked, or someone drove one of those obnoxious import cars by my house. Also nobody could be home, you can hear everything. Rather than try to silence the world I decided to improviss

First I took a box and stuffed it with insulation like so:

This cut down noise considerably. It also gave a much clearer, deeper sound that's difficult to explain. If it looks stupid but it works, it isn't stupid. 

I still had way too much neighborhood noise, so my final recording area looked like this:

Yup, that's a supply closet! I managed to remove the echo and background noise from here fairly well. 

This was my biggest obstacle by far and I worked through it. 

###Why do I find this fun?

So I spent hours writing out scripts, recording and re-recording. I set up goofy stages and filmed things with my webcam. It was a ton of work. But it was.... fun.

Teaching people is a huge passion of mine, and I love doing these courses. I am bitten by the bug and this will be the first of many courses from me. Got a few laid out in the queue for this year. 

During the process of building this I auditioned for <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> and got signed (yes!), so I'm now working on a course for them. Pluralsight has some exacting standards as well as branding and other style preferences so it's a bit more work. On the flipside of that they have people with tons of knowledge helping you out and cheering you on. It's pushing me to be a better instructor fast and I love it! But that's for another article. 

### Do you want to do this?

If you are itching to become an instructor, contact me. I have learned a TON over the last few months, and will gladly share. I'm going to do a series of articles soon detailing how to get started and tricks I've learned. Stay tuned or <a href="http://eepurl.com/b3Y9Wz">sign up for my newsletter</a>. 

More to come soon!!!
