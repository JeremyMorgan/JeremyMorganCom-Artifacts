Rick Rescorla may not be a familiar name to most of you, but he should be. Rick was a director of security for Morgan Stanley who anticipated an aircraft attack on the World Trade Center and created a plan for it.

As he led groups of people out, he kept going back in. When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, "As soon as I make sure everyone else is out".

Rick was on the 10th floor when the building collapsed. His remains have never been found.

I just found out about Rick today, as many of you just did. Share this story or stories like it. Let's keep their memory alive as well as the memory of all the other men and women who died that day, whether they be police officers, firefighters or just average citizens like Rick Rescorla who cared enough about their fellow people to help them out.
