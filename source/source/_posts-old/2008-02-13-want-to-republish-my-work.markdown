I've been getting a lot of emails about using my articles on other websites, or even printed materials. Some are asking about getting permission, and cost, etc. I'll explain how you can do that, absolutely free. 

**Can I put your articles on my website?**

The short answer is yes. Everything published on JeremyMorgan.com is covered by a [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org) license. This means you can use my content free of charge, as long as you follow certain rules. 

I use two different CC licenses: 

**Articles: **

The articles are covered under the [CCA - No Derivative](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/) License. This means you can copy, distribute and share my work free of charge. This means you can use my articles:

For your website/forums
In your newsletter
In printed materials - newsletters, magazines and books. 
In your Ebook
On your blog. 

The only restriction is you cannot modify or add on to the work in any way. You also must attribute my work, meaning if it is used online, you must display that I am the author, with a link back to JeremyMorgan.com. If it is in printed material, you must credit me as well, but you may spell out jeremymorgan.com (obviously hyperlinks don't work on paper). 

You may also use it for commercial purposes, meaning if you're selling a product, service, or publication you may use the articles, provided the rules above are followed, with no royalties paid to me. 

**Software / Code**

Any software or source code, html, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc is covered under the [CCA - Attribution Share](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/) license. This means everything that applies to articles is true, you can use my source code and applications on your site, in your book, or even in your commercial software, again with no royalties. The difference is you can modify, add on to or reduce the work, or integrate it into your own application. If you add on or modify it, you must share the work and make it available if requested. You do not need to include a hyperlink in my web applications, but you must leave the attribution information in the license. 

**Why do I do this? **
I was asked this by someone who wanted to purchase an article from me. Why the heck am I doing this? For one, I want to contribute to the body of free knowledge about SEO. This site is by far more of a "for fun" site than a commercial one. I want to help others, and hopefully help out in some small way.

Also, I want to get my name out there. Obviously the more people publish my work, the more my name will be out there, and the more well known my work will become. Not everything has to be done for a profit! 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. If you're interested in doing the same thing with your work, check out the [creative commons](http://creativecommons.org) site, and choose a license. 

So use my work, spread it freely and hopefully it helps!
